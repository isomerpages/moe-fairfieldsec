<h2>Parents Gateway</h2>
<p>The Parent Gateway (PG) Mobile App is an initiative by MOE to enable parents
to interact with schools more conveniently regarding administrative and
financial matters. Parents will also be able to use this app to stay updated
on the school’s programme and activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have two or more children and they are in different schools, you
will be able to receive notifications for all your children on the same
PG App. We strongly encourage all parents to download and use the PG App
to stay updated on the school’s programme and activities.&nbsp;</p>

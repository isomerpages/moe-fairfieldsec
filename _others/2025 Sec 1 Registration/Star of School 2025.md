<h2><strong>Start of School 2025 - Important Information for Students and Parents / Guardians</strong></h2>
<p>To ensure that Secondary 1 students are well prepared for the start of
their secondary school journey with us, please note the following information.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>(A) <u>Reporting &amp; Dismissal Time and Venue</u></strong>&nbsp;
<br>Daily reporting time:&nbsp; Students are encouraged to be in school <strong>by 7:25am</strong> for
silent reading.&nbsp; They will be considered <strong>late</strong> if they
arrive in school from <strong>7:28am onwards</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>Reporting venue on Day 1: Parade Square*&nbsp;
<br>*The Student Leaders of the Secondary 1 Orientation Programme will guide
them to the parade square.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>(B) <u>School Attire and Appearance</u></strong>&nbsp;

<p>On normal school days, students must wear the full school uniform, as
above, or the school polo T-shirt with school bottoms (i.e. school shorts,
pants or skirt). However, on days when students have PE lessons, except
for Chapel days, students can be in half-uniform, i.e. school PE T-shirt
and school uniform bottoms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Thursdays, when Lower Secondary students attend Chapel, they are to
be in full school uniform with their school ties (both boys and girls).
If students have PE on Thursdays, they can be in half-uniform after their
PE lessons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Fridays, which are Dress Down Days, students can be in half-uniform
with any school-related T-shirt.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>All tops, except for the blouse, must be tucked in at all times whether
in full uniform, half-uniform or PE attire.&nbsp;</p>
<p>*Note that the school badge will be presented to the Secondary 1 students
during the Installation Ceremony on Friday <strong>10 January 2025</strong>,
and students will receive their name tags by the middle of Term 1 if they
make payment when they purchase their books/stationery from the school
bookshop.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>(C) <u>Locker Arrangement</u></strong>&nbsp;
<br>All students are issued a locker and students are required to use their
own locks to secure the locker. Students should <strong>bring along a lock on the first day of school</strong> so
that they can secure their belongings. All mobile phones should be kept
in the locker during curriculum time, including recess.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>(D) <u>Secondary 1 3D2N Residential Camp (21 - 23 May 2025)</u></strong>&nbsp;
<br>The school will be organising a camp for Secondary 1 students as part
of the schoolâ€™s FLEX programme. It will be held at an external campsite.
Parents / Guardians will receive more information with regards to the camp
via Parents Gateway (PG) at a later date.

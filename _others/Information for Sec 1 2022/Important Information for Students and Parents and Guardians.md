#### (A)&nbsp;Reporting &amp; Dismissal Time and Venue

Daily reporting time:&nbsp; Students should be at the school’s assembly venue&nbsp;**by 7:35 am every day.** They will be considered late if they arrive in school from 7:28am onwards. 

Reporting venue on Day 1: Parade Square*

*The Student Leaders of the Secondary 1 Orientation Programme will guide them to the parade square.

On normal school days, students must wear the full school uniform, as above, or the school polo T-shirt with school bottoms (i.e. school shorts, pants or skirt). However, on days when students have PE lessons, except for Chapel days, students can be in half-uniform, i.e. school PE T-shirt and school uniform bottoms.

On Tuesdays, when Lower Secondary students attend Chapel, they are to be in full school uniform with their school ties (both boys and girls). If students have PE on Tuesdays, they can be in half-uniform after their PE lessons.

On Fridays, which are Dress Down Days, students can be in half-uniform with any school-related T-shirt. 

All tops, except for the blouse, must be tucked in at all times whether in full uniform, half-uniform or PE attire.

*Note that the school badge will be presented to the Secondary 1 students during the Installation Ceremony on 5 January 2024, and students will receive their name tags by the middle of Term 1 if they make payment when they purchase their books/stationery from the school bookshop.

  

#### (C)&nbsp;Locker Arrangement

All students are issued a locker and students are required to use their own locks to secure the locker. Students should&nbsp;**bring along a lock on the first day of school**&nbsp;so that they can secure their belongings. All mobile phones should be kept in the locker during curriculum time, including recess.

  

 

#### (D)&nbsp;Secondary 1 3-Day Non Residential Camp (15 - 17 May 2024)

The school will be organising a camp for Secondary 1 students as part of the school’s FLEX programme. It will be held at an external campsite. Parents / Guardians will receive more information with regards to the camp via Parents Gateway (PG) at a later date.

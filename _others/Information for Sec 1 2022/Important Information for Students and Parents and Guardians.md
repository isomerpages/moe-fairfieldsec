 On days when students have PE lessons, students can be in half-uniform, i.e. school PE t-shirt, school uniform bottoms (school shorts or skirt). PE T-shirts must be tucked in.

On Tuesdays, when students attend Chapel, they are to be in full school uniform with their school ties on (both boys and girls). If students have PE on Tuesdays, they can be in half-uniform after their PE lessons.

On Fridays, which are Dress Down Days, students can choose to wear the school polo t-shirt, PE t-shirt or an official CCA t-shirt with their school uniform bottoms. All tops (except the school polo t-shirt) must be tucked in.

\*Note that the school badge will be presented to students during the Installation Ceremony on 6 January, and students will receive their name tags by the middle of Term 1.

Parents are kindly requested to complete the form and return the form to their child’s / ward’s Form Teacher by **7 January 2022**. The information gathered from this form will help the school in planning for the necessary support structures for the students if necessary. A NIL reply is required.

  

#### (E) Secondary 1 3-Day Non Residential Camp (8 - 10 March 2022)

The school will be organising a camp for Secondary 1 students as part of the school’s FLEX programme. It will be held in school and the students will be travelling to different venues for activities.

### Purchase of School Attire and Books for 2022

#### Guidelines    

Dear Parent/Guardian,

  

Due to the prevailing SMM, we strongly encourage you to make your purchase via the respective online platforms provided by the vendors. On-site purchase is strongly discouraged.  

  

For those who have opted for self-collection, do adhere to stipulated collection dates (see attached). Please note also that only one parent/guardian and one student are allowed to enter the school premises for self-collection.  You will have to show your time slot (using your mobile phone) to the guard before entering.

  

Should you have further queries, please do not hesitate to contact the General Office between 8am - 5pm.

  

Thank you.

### FMS(S)’ Responsibility to Society

#### Our Commitment

Service is an integral part of our school’s mission and ethos. Our mission is to develop every student into leaders of good character who are equipped to serve God, nation, community and school.

 As a mission school, we take heed of God’s word:

_“For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many” (Mark 10:45)._ 

#### Students

We aim that by the time our students graduate from our school, they will develop a commitment to community and heart of service. Over the course of the four-year service learning programme, students would have participated in at least 80 hours of service. By reflecting on these experiences, our students grow in their care and empathy for others, one of our school’s core values.

#### Staff

In addition, the school recognises the importance of our staff being good role models for our students, to care for and reach out to the less fortunate in the community. Besides the service learning that our staff carry out with students in their CCA groups and overseas service learning trips, we also structure one afternoon per semester for all our school staff, including the EAS, to serve the community. 

### Our Community

#### Local

The school believes that every Fairsian is blessed to be a blessing to others. Therefore we strive to connect with, and contribute to the local and overseas communities. Our students have been actively involved in various community projects such as organising a Block Party for residents in the Dover Road estate since 2008. CCA groups and Sec 4 classes also initiate their own community service projects.

Since 2011, our staff have been working with the Fei Yue Family Service Centre to reach out to the elderly at the Senior Activity Centre at Holland Close.

#### Overseas

In addition, our Secondary 3 students perform community service during their Trips for International Experience. We have established partnerships with overseas communities such as Care Corner and Vineyard Methodist School in Chiangmai, Thailand. 

#### Our Environment

Fairfield believes that being an influential leader that serves the community includes being a good steward of the environment. We have an environmental policy that addresses three goals.

#### Goal 1: Reducing our Carbon Footprint

**This is achieved through the following strategies:**

*   Reducing our consumption of utilities. The school adopts a fit-for-purpose approach, with strict guidelines on the use of air-conditioning. Permission needs to be sought if air-conditioned facilities are used outside the defined operating hours. The OM reports utilities consumption to staff on a monthly basis and members of the Environmental Awareness PDOC update students during morning assembly.
*   Reducing wastage from printing. The school aims to reduce wastage by providing guidelines to staff on the use of the school’s printing facilities.
*   Recycling. The school has a paper recycling programme for both staff and students. This is incorporated into the 4 year service-learning framework for students.
*   Zero Styrofoam in the Canteen. The school does not allow the canteen vendors to serve food using Styrofoam containers.  Hence, every staff member is given a reusable plastic container that they can use when buying take-away meals at the canteen.

  

#### Goal 2: Creating a Clean and Green School Environment

**This is achieved through the following strategies:**

*   Clean and hygienic canteen. Staff and students are expected to return their plates and cutlery to trolleys at the designated area after their meals. There are also rubbish bins conveniently located around the canteen.
*   Clean toilets. The school is systematically renovating its toilets to improve lighting and ventilation.
*   Landscaping. The school has been adding landscaping yearly to create more green spaces around the school to create a more pleasant environment for staff and students.
*   Clean classrooms. Students are not allowed to bring food out of the canteen. Every class has to draw up a daily roster for cleaning the classroom. Classroom cleanliness has been incorporated into a student creed GRACE and teachers are expected to check that the classroom is clean before they start the lesson.

  

#### Goal 3: Raising Environmental Awareness through Experiential Learning

**This is achieved through the following strategies:**

*   Interdisciplinary River Studies. Sec 1 students test the water in a few rivers as part of the Interdisciplinary River Studies Project.
*   Renewable Energy.  The school has lessons on solar energy.

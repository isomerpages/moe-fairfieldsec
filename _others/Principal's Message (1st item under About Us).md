### Principal's Message (1st item under About Us)

<img src="/images/fmssprincipal.png" style="width:183px;height:280px;margin-left:15px;" align = "right">**Welcome to Fairfield!**

It gives me great joy to share more about our school with you.

Fairfield is a Methodist school that is built on the foundation of God's love. It was founded in 1888 by a missionary Miss Sophia Blackmore and has always provided holistic education based on Christian values. There is a strong culture of care that permeates all that we do in Fairfield.

_Oh! It's Fairfield, at Fairfield_<br>
_Where all our hearts are light_<br>
_Where love is in the sunshine_<br>
_And all the world is bright._<br>

When you join Fairfield, you will experience the warmth of the Fairfield family that includes Fairfield Methodist School (Primary), the Board of Management, the Alumni, the Methodist Church, the parents, teachers and students. Among the many blessings that our students enjoy from the Fairfield family is the T-Zone, a non-profit café run by our volunteer Parent Support Group, who are our Partners-in-Education (PIE).

Fairfield's vision is to develop our students to become active, lifelong learners and influential leaders. We believe that God places the students in our school for a purpose; hence, we are passionate about developing their God-given talents through an excellent holistic education. We aim to develop the four Fairsian outcomes of Personhood, Commitment to Community, Heart of Service, and Wisdom in all our students.

We subscribe to the philosophy that "Leadership is Influence" (John C. Maxwell). A person who demonstrates commitment to his team, serves others and attracts others to follow him by virtue of his character and personal qualities is a leader regardless of whether he carries any title. All our students are enriched through programmes during the Week of Holistic, Enriched and Experiential Learning (WHEEL), which is an important Fairfield tradition that reflects our philosophy of education.

Fairfield students pursue excellence by seeking to do their best in all that they do. We give thanks for their achievements and celebrate their varied successes with them. We invite you to read about our graduates like Mr Joshua Jesudason who not only exemplifies the four Fairsian Outcomes, but was also awarded the President’s Scholarship in 2013.

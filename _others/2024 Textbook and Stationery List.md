### Purchase of School Textbooks, Stationery and School Attire


Dear Parents/Guardians,

<u>Guidelines for Year-End Purchase of 2025 School Textbooks, Stationery and School Attire</u>

**Mode of Purchase**<br>
There are 2 options for purchases: you can either buy the items in person on the designated dates within the school, or you can opt for online purchases through the respective vendorsâ€™ website using the provided links. Please note that both vendors will apply delivery charges. You can only opt for self-collection when buying books and stationery.

**Updates from Uniform Vendor: Shanghai School Uniforms Pte Ltd**<br>
As part of their ongoing sustainability efforts, Shanghai Uniforms have discontinued the use of plastic bags in their retail store. Instead, they now charge 10 cents per bag provided. This practice will apply for their uniform sales in school as well. Do note and prepare your reusable bags to support their efforts.

If you have any additional questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to get in touch with the General Office during our office hours, from 8am to 5pm.

Please refer to the&nbsp;[Schedule for Year-End Purchase of School Textbooks, Stationery and School Attire](/files/Parents/Admin%20Matters/2023/schedule.pdf)&nbsp;for more information.

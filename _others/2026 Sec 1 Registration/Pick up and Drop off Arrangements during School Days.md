<h3><u>Road Safety and Traffic Guidelines</u></h3>
<p>To keep all students safe during arrival and dismissal, we seek your support
in following the guidelines below:</p>
<p>For parents/guardians who drive:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Please slow down and stay alert for pedestrians within the school zone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Follow the instructions of our security officers to maintain safety and
smooth traffic flow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure your child/ward alights only at the designated drop-off point at
the end of the Technical Block.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For safety reasons, do not drop off your child/ward at the car park, as
this creates congestion and potential hazards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remind your child/ward to practise good road safety habits, such as using
pedestrian crossings and avoiding jaywalking or using mobile devices while
crossing the road.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><u>Vehicle Entry Restrictions</u></h3>
<p>Please note that vehicles are not allowed to enter the school compound
after 7.28am. Additionally, parents/guardians should not drive into the
school for pick-up at dismissal, unless it is raining. This helps us maintain
safety and reduces congestion at the school gates.</p>
<p><em>Rainy Weather Pick-up:</em>
<br>On rainy days during dismissal, pick-up will take place at the covered
area near the Technical Block.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Parking and waiting within the school compound are not permitted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students should arrange with their parents/guardians to be picked up only
when they have arrived at the designated sheltered pick-up point.<strong><br></strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>

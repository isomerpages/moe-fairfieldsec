### 2022 DSA ─ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

  

##### 1) How do I know if my child is eligible for the DSA?

All Primary 6 students in Singapore may apply for the DSA to the school of their choice, based on the school’s criteria to select non-academic talents for a more flexible and broad-based education system.

  

##### 2) Can my child apply for the DSA to your school based on academic results alone, or based on another CCA not on your list?

For our DSA exercise, we would only accept applicants based on the 4 Sports, 5 Performing Arts CCAs and Leadership requirements stated on our DSA page.

  

##### 3) What are the expectations of a successful DSA candidate?

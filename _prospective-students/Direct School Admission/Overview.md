### Direct School Admission (DSA)


Fairfield Methodist School (Secondary) welcomes applications from Primary 6 students in the current academic year to take part in the Direct School Admission (DSA-Sec) Exercise. We seek to provide an environment which will nurture your abilities and enable you to reach your fullest potential as a student sportsperson/performer.

Parents and students are encouraged to choose wisely based on the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind our school's academic and non-academic requirements, and the programmes that are available to develop the area of talent.

  

Successful students, regardless of stream, will gain admission into FMS(S) for the academic year beginning January 2024 and will complete their secondary school education in FMS(S) as long as they meet the set criteria for DSA to FMS(S) and pass the PSLE.

<p><strong>2025 Direct School Admission (DSA)</strong>
</p>
<p><strong><u>Introduction</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Fairfield Methodist School (Secondary) welcomes applications from Primary
6 students in the current academic year to take part in the 2025 Direct
School Admission (DSA-Sec) Exercise. Introduced in 2004, the DSA provides
a pathway for students to gain admission to secondary schools based on
their interests, aptitude, and potential, beyond their performance at Primary
School Leaving Examination (PSLE). Primary 6 students who do not participate
in the DSA-Sec will continue to seek admission based on their PSLE score
through the Secondary 1 Posting.</p>

<h2>Access to School Car Park</h2>
<p>Designated red parking lots are intended for season parking and are strictly
reserved for staff of the school who have paid for season parking.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>Parents / guardians are not allowed to park in red parking lots.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Use of the School Car Park during School Dismissal</u>&nbsp; </strong>
<br>Parents / Guardians are not permitted to drive into the school for pick-up
during dismissal, except on rainy days. On such occasions, pick-up will
take place at the covered area near the D&amp;T block. Please be reminded
that parking and waiting are not allowed. Students should ensure they coordinate
with their parents / guardians to be picked up only when they are at the
designated pick-up point.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Visitor Parking</u></strong>
<br>White parking lots are for visitors to the school on official business.
This can include parents who are here to meet up with teachers on official
matters. As there are limited white lots, once the lots are all taken up,
any visitor will have to find parking outside of the school.&nbsp;</p>

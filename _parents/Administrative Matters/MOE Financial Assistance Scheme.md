<h4><strong>Application Procedure</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Application is open throughout the year, <strong>with the 2026 application cycle commencing on Tuesday, 21 October 2025.</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To make application more convenient, MOE has onboarded Household Means
Eligibility System (HOMES) for means-testing of financial assistance from
the 2026 application cycle onwards. This streamlines the process as most
parents will no longer need to submit supporting documents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Siblings in the same school can submit all their applications using one
form.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apply for MOE FAS via <a href="https://form.gov.sg/68b7e92465cd36be287889c6" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">eFAS</a>, or through
the ‘Services’ tab in Parents Gateway, or approach the school directly
with a hardcopy application form.&nbsp;<strong>Online submission is strongly encouraged.</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students who are ComCare beneficiaries will be automatically granted MOE
FAS for 2026. There is no requirement for this group of students to apply
for MOE FAS.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Supporting Documents</strong></h4>
<p><strong>For application via eFAS</strong>, there is no need to prepare
any income supporting documents if you and your household members only
have employment and/or trade income and do not have other administrative
income which are taxable (e.g. rental income, dividends and taxable investment
income etc).&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>For hardcopy applications</strong>, all compulsory documents must
be submitted together with your completed application form.&nbsp;You can
refer to pages 6 and 7 of the application form for detailed requirements.</p>

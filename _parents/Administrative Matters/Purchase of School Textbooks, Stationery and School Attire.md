<h3>Purchase of School Textbooks, Stationery and School Attire</h3>
<p>Dear Parents/Guardians,</p>
<p><u>Guidelines for Year-End Purchase of 2025 School Textbooks, Stationery and School Attire</u>
</p>
<p><strong>Mode of Purchase</strong>
<br>There are 2 options for purchases: you can either buy the items in person
on the designated dates within the school, or you can opt for online purchases
through the respective vendorsâ€™ website using the provided links. Please
note that both vendors will apply delivery charges. You can only opt for
self-collection when buying books and stationery.</p>
<p><strong>Updates from Uniform Vendor: Shanghai School Uniforms Pte Ltd</strong>
<br>As part of their ongoing sustainability efforts, Shanghai Uniforms have
discontinued the use of plastic bags in their retail store. Instead, they
now charge 10 cents per bag provided. This practice will apply for their
uniform sales in school as well. Do note and prepare your reusable bags
to support their efforts.</p>
<p>If you have any additional questions or concerns, please do not hesitate
to get in touch with the General Office during our office hours, from 8am
to 5pm.</p>

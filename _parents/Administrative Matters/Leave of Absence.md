<h3>Leave of Absence</h3>
<p><strong>Leave of Absence (LOA) scheme</strong>
</p>
<p>The LOA scheme allows your child to rejoin the school after they return
from overseas.</p>
<p>If your child is granted LOA, they will remain as a registered student
of the school. They can then be re-admitted to the school directly after
returning to Singapore. The LOA is tagged to your childâ€™s current school
and cannot be transferred to another school.</p>
<p>Please refer to MOE website (<a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/returning-singaporeans" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.moe.gov.sg/returning-singaporeans</a>)
for more information.</p>
<p>If you would like to apply for LOA, please submit the application via
this&nbsp;<a href="https://form.gov.sg/687d918c9920070bcb23bccf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">link</a>.</p>

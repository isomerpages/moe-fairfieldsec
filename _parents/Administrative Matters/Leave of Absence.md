### Leave of Absence

  

**Leave of Absence (LOA) scheme**
  

The LOA scheme allows your child to rejoin the school after they return from overseas.  

  

If your child is granted LOA, they will remain as a registered student of the school. They can then be re-admitted to the school directly after returning to Singapore. The LOA is tagged to your child’s current school and cannot be transferred to another school.

  

Please refer to MOE website ([https://www.moe.gov.sg/returning-singaporeans](https://www.moe.gov.sg/returning-singaporeans)) for more information. 

  

If you would like to apply for LOA, please submit the application via this [link](https://form.gov.sg/60c89fa8cb39700015bd3ce5). 

  

Should you have any queries about the annual fee or other matters, please contact the General Office at 6778 8702 during office hours or email to [fmss@moe.edu.sg](mailto:fmss@moe.edu.sg).

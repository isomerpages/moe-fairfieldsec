FMS(S) has selected iPad with iPadOS for students for the following rationale:

* It is suitable for learning on-the-go.
* It comes with smooth inking with Apple Pencil.
* It has many educational apps available in iOS app store for T&amp;L.
* Apple Classroom allows teachers to better monitor, control and share resources with students during lessons.

Parents are given 3 options for NDLP

      <td>**Option 3** Use existing iPad</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

### **Personal Learning Device (PLD) (2021 - 2023)**

FMS(S) has selected iPad with iPadOS for students for the following rationale:

* It is suitable for learning on-the-go.

### <label for="accordion2">Option 2 – Purchase New iPad on Your Own and Option 3 Bring Existing iPad</label>

Parents who opt not to purchase the MOE iPad bundle must ensure that their new or existing iPads meet the following conditions:

*   Compatible with Device Management Application (DMA) software
*   Must have a compatible stylus and keyboard cover (e.g Apple Pencil, Logitech Touch Combo 3)
*   DMA must be installed on the iPad
*   Factory reset will be required (Existing data in the device will be wiped out)
	
Parents who are opting for Option 2, purchasing a new iPad on your own, are strongly recommended to consider the add-on, Apple Care+ for the following rationale:

*   Warranty being extended to 2 years.
*   Servicing can be done at Apple Service Centres.
*   Accidental damage protection is included with a service fee

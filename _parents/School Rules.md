### School Rules

### Rules &amp; Regulations


##### I ATTENDANCE AND PUNCTUALITY


_Students need to take ownership of their learning by being present and punctual for lessons. Students who come late will lose out on valuable learning time._&nbsp;

  

● Attendance in school is compulsory. Absence from school is permitted only when it is supported by a Medical Certificate (MC) or a parent’s letter with valid reasons. Students should not submit more than five excuse letters per semester. Subsequently, students will be booked for Absence Without Valid Reasons, which is deemed as truancy.&nbsp;

  

● If students wish to leave or absent themselves from school for private matters, parents need to apply for leave of absence for their child through his or her Form Teacher. Permission will be granted on a case-by-case basis by the Principal (P) or Vice-Principals (VP).

  

● Students must be punctual for all school functions, lessons and CCA. Students who are late for school assembly will be booked. Students who are very late for school i.e. after the first period begins, will be booked for skipping lessons.

  

● Students who arrive after the end of morning assembly must register at the guard post and obtain a late-coming green slip before they can proceed to join their class.&nbsp; Students caught bypassing the guard post without obtaining a green slip will face more severe consequences.&nbsp;

  

● Students are expected to be in their respective classrooms for lessons within five minutes of the school bell. Students who are late without a valid reason will be booked.

  

● Students are not to leave the school premises before the dismissal bell without special permission from their Form Teacher/HOD Discipline/VP/P. In the event that the student is unwell and needs to leave the school early, his or her parent or guardian will be contacted and the student is expected to produce a MC the next day. When special permission is granted, students must proceed to the General Office to sign out before leaving school.

  

● Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) are an integral part of our students’ holistic education and CCA participation is compulsory for all students. Missing CCA sessions without valid reasons is considered the same offence as skipping lessons. Students who fail to support their absence with an MC will be booked for skipping CCA.


##### II&nbsp; DAILY ASSEMBLIES

_Morning assemblies are meant for the student body to gather together as a school community. During this time, students show their love for the country through the singing of the National Anthem and reciting of the Pledge. Daily devotions follow after this as a means for students to learn values and appreciate God._

  

● When the music plays to signal assembly time, students are to assemble in the parade square.

  

● By the first bell, students should already be seated according to their index number in their classes at the parade square. All Form Teachers will then mark attendance.&nbsp; Students who are not at the parade square by the start of morning assembly will be considered late.

  

● Students must be in full school uniform for morning assembly. Only students who are having PE are allowed to come in half-uniform (except on chapel days). Attire (includes grooming) checks will be conducted daily. Students with improper attire will be booked. Students whose attire or grooming cannot be rectified on the spot may be sent home for rectification.

  

● Boys are to put on their ties on chapel days and for special school functions to show their respect for the significance of the occasion.

  

● Students must stand at attention during the National Anthem and Pledge-Taking. Students who are Singapore citizens must sing the National Anthem and take the Pledge. Students will take the Pledge with the right fist over the heart.

  

● Students must sing the school song with pride and respect to demonstrate their commitment to the school community.



### &nbsp;&nbsp;CLASSROOM BEHAVIOUR

##### I CONDUCT DURING LESSON TIME

##### VALUABLES&nbsp;

The school believes that it is important for students to show empathy and understanding of others in the school community. Hence, students are discouraged from bringing expensive personal belongings to the school, as these can become distractions for the student body. By not bringing expensive electronic devices and jewellery to school, students also prevent any feelings of envy and inferiority from forming unnecessarily. This way, students do not have to worry about the safety of their expensive belongings as well.  

  

  

### USE OF MOBILE PHONES, ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION DEVICES, AND TECHNOLOGY

_Students are to be discerning, prudent and responsible in their use of technology. Students demonstrate their commitment to community when they consider the impact their online activities have on others._

● Mobile phones are not to be used during curriculum time, including free periods and recesses / lunch breaks. They must be switched off and kept in the students’ lockers during curriculum time. Students who use their phones during curriculum time will be booked and their phones will be confiscated for a period of time. Recalcitrant students will face stiffer consequences.

  

● Mobile phones and electronic communication devices (e.g., smart watches, fitness trackers) are strictly disallowed in examination premises. When these items are found in any student’s possession during the examinations, he/she will be booked for possession of disallowed items.

  

● Personal Learning Devices (PLD) are to be used responsibly for academic purposes. They should not be left unattended (e.g. during PE) and should be kept in the students’ lockers for safekeeping. PLDs should not be charged in school.&nbsp; The school will not bear responsibility for the loss of these devices.

  

● Students should be responsible in their use of technology, including the internet and social media.

  

● Students are not to use the technology to abuse or hurt the school, her staff or students in any way.

  

● Students are not to use the technology for personal gain and inappropriate purposes (e.g. surfing pornographic / hate sites, downloading pirated software/files, hacking into school or external systems, etc). Photographs and videos of schoolmates and staff should not be taken without their permission.

  

● If the school has reason to suspect that a student’s electronic device has been used to commit an offence, the school may confiscate the electronic device for further investigation.

  

● The school views such offences very seriously and will involve the police if necessary.

  

### DISALLOWED ITEMS

*   Students are not allowed to bring items used for gambling purposes.

### THE CANTEEN

### School Rules

#### Rules & Regulations


##### I ATTENDANCE AND PUNCTUALITY


_Students need to take ownership of their learning by being present and punctual for lessons. Students who come late will lose out on valuable learning time._ 

  

● Attendance in school is compulsory. Absence from school is permitted only when it is supported by a Medical Certificate (MC) or a parent’s letter with valid reasons. Students should not submit more than three excuse letters per semester. Subsequently, students will be booked for Absence Without Valid Reasons, which is deemed as truancy. 

  

● If students wish to leave or absent themselves from school for private matters, parents need to apply for leave of absence for their child through his or her Form Teacher. Permission will be granted on a case-by-case basis by the Principal (P) or Vice-Principals (VP).

  

● Students must be punctual for all school functions, lessons and CCA. Students who are late for school assembly will be booked. Students who are very late for school i.e. after the first period begins, will be booked for skipping lessons.

  

● Students who arrive after the end of morning assembly must register at the guard post and obtain a late-coming green slip before they can proceed to join their class.  Students caught bypassing the guard post without obtaining a green slip will face more severe consequences. 

  

● Students are expected to be in their respective classrooms for lessons within five minutes of the school bell. Students who are late without a valid reason will be booked.

  

● Students are not to leave the school premises before the dismissal bell without special permission from their Form Teacher/HOD Discipline/VP/P. In the event that the student is unwell and needs to leave the school early, his or her parent or guardian will be contacted and the student is expected to produce a MC the next day. When special permission is granted, students must proceed to the General Office to sign out before leaving school.

  

● Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) are an integral part of our students’ holistic education and CCA participation is compulsory for all students. Missing CCA sessions without valid reasons is considered the same offence as skipping lessons. Students who fail to support their absence with an MC will be booked for skipping CCA.


##### II  DAILY ASSEMBLIES

A student spends most of his/her time in the classroom as it is the main place for academic learning. Hence a student’s behaviour and attitude in this space should be a positive reflection of his/her attitude towards learning. Form and Subject teachers convey expectations to students of the right way to behave so that everyone can learn effectively.   


Teachers can address and record any student offences during curriculum time. Students with repeated offences will need to take progressive corrective measures to demonstrate their commitment to be part of this learning community. Any student who fails to heed the warning of the teachers and/or commits any major offence will be referred to the Discipline Team for further action.


##### 1.3  Forms of Corrective Measures

Corrective measures are used to help students understand both the consequences of their actions and the right values on which their actions should be based. Corrective measures are a form of deterrence and a way to teach students to respect the school, the school staff and their peers. Hence, the severity of corrective measures will escalate depending on a student’s behaviour and attitude.



##### *   DETENTION

Detention sessions take place after curriculum time in the afternoons, under adult supervision. These are opportunities for students to serve the school, reflect on their actions, learn from their mistakes, poor behaviour or attitude and to change for the better. The duration of each session is one hour and students will be assigned tasks to keep the school clean.



##### *   CANING

Caning is meted out to male students who have committed major offences. It will usually take place in the Vice-Principal’s Office. Depending on the severity of the offence, subsequent caning may be carried out in classrooms, at level assemblies or in front of the whole school.


##### *   OTHERS 

Other forms of corrective measures include drawing up a self-discipline plan, in-house/home suspension, and expulsion. 

Counselling will be availed to students who need the support as it will equip them with skills to cope with their problems.

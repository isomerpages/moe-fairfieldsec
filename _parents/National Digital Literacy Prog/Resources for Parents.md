<label for="accordion1">Use of Edusave</label>

<div>
<p>

MOE has provided an Edusave top-up of $200 in 2020, and will provide another Edusave top-up of $200 in May 2021 (as part of the Household Support Package announced in Budget 2021), to all eligible Singaporean students in primary and secondary schools. This is on top of the annual Edusave contribution of $290 for secondary students and $230 for primary students. Students who are Singapore citizens can use their Edusave to pay fully or partly for the PLD, after setting aside provision for payment of 2nd tier miscellaneous fees. Parents/Guardians can also choose to pay cash for the PLD.

<label for="accordion2">Financial Assistance</label>

<div>
	
Subsidies are available for students who require funding support to purchase a PLD. Please note that it is compulsory for all students on the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS) to use their Edusave to pay for the PLD, after subsidies have been granted. Please see the table below for information on the eligibility for the subsidy:

| Students eligible for subsidy | Income criteria | How to Apply for Subsidy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Students under MOE FAS | Gross Household Income (“GHI”) is $2,750 or less, or Per Capita Income (“PCI”)\* is $690 or less) | No action required. Automatically subsidised for the PLD. |
| Students under School-based FAS | GHI is $4,000 or less, or PCI is $1,000 or less | Approach the school’s General Office to apply for a subsidy. |
| Students who are currently not under the MOE FAS or School-based FAS | GHI is $4,000 or less, or PCI is $1,000 or less | Approach the school’s General Office to apply for a subsidy. |

**\* PCI**&nbsp;refers to the GHI divided by the total number of family members in the household.

<label for="accordion3">Software Applications</label>

<div>

The school will progressively roll out Software Applications that will be vital for students’ teaching and learning. These include:&nbsp;

(a)&nbsp;**Student iCON**: Every student will be provided with access to the Google Suite set of tools, including email address.  
(b)&nbsp;**Microsoft ProPlus**: Every student will be able to use Microsoft Office tools that include Word, PowerPoint and Excel.&nbsp;  
(c)&nbsp;**Zoom**: Every student will be given a Zoom free account with 40 min time limit for their video conferencing needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;

The school will need to use students’ full name, Student iCON ID and class to set up user accounts. The school may also choose to roll out applications other than those listed above.
	
On top of this, students are also provided with school-managed Apple ID which comes with 200GB of iCloud storage.

All students are required to sign into FMS(S) Managed Apple ID so that teachers are able to use Apple Classroom during lessons.

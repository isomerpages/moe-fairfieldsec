# Device Management Application (DMA)

All students’ devices are installed with the MOE Device Management Application (DMA) as part of the measures to enable a safe and conducive learning environment for students. The purpose of the MOE DMA is to:

*   keep your child safe online by blocking off undesirable websites
*   allow parents to be aware of their childrens' activities on their childrens’ devices
*   limit screen time for your child, when necessary

The DMA will be funded by MOE and will be uninstalled from your child’s device when your child graduates or leaves the school.

During school hours, MOE and school DMA settings will be put in place to help students to focus on learning in a safe and conducive online environment. As default, these settings will continue to be in place after school hours as well. Parents are recommended to continue with the Default settings after school hours especially for parents who prefer not to or do not feel ready to manage their child’s use of device on their own. There are also Option A and B for parents who would prefer other settings&nbsp;**after school hours**.

The diagram below shows the summary of DMA settings during school hours and after-school hours.

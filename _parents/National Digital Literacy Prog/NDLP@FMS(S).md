# NDLP@FMS(S)
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p><strong>At MOEâ€™s Committee of Supply Debate in March 2020, MOE launched the&nbsp;National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP)&nbsp;for our schools and Institutes of Higher Learning to make digital learning inclusive by equipping students with the digital literacies to be future-ready.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A key thrust of the programme is to equip all secondary students with a&nbsp;<strong>Personal Learning Device (PLD).</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Learning with a PLD @ FMS(S)</h3>
<p>At FMS(S), our guidelines to our student on of how to use their PLDs follow  the acronym R.E.A.D.Y as shown in the graphic below.</p>

#### Welcome to Fairfield Family

  

Hello! We are the FMS(S) Partners-in-Education (PiE). We are a community of parents with diverse backgrounds, experiences and skills, coming together for one common goal - to support Fairfield's mission:

  

"To provide a holistic education in a Christian environment to nurture leaders of good character who are equipped to serve God, nation, community and school"

  

The next 4 - 5 years will be an exciting, life transforming season of your child's growing years. We encourage you to join us on this journey of discovery with your child and make a difference in his/her life.

  

As Partners-in-Education, we aim to:

  

#### 1. Be Present Welcome to Fairfield Family

To lend support to school events.


#### 2. Be Equipped

 To empower ourselves to be more effective parents.
  

#### 3. Be Connected

To be a support network for parents and students.
  

#### 4. Be a Blessing

To be parent volunteers and making a difference.

  

We collaborate with the School on various projects and platforms throughout the year, so as to promote strong home-school partnership.

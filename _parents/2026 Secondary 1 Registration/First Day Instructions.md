silent reading.&nbsp; They will be considered <strong>late</strong> if they
arrive in school from <strong>7.28am onwards</strong>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On <strong>normal school days</strong>, students must wear the full school
uniform, as above, or the school polo T-shirt with school bottoms (i.e.
school shorts, pants or skirt). However, on days when students have PE
lessons, except for Chapel days, students can be in half-uniform, i.e.
school PE T-shirt and school uniform bottoms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On <strong>Thursdays</strong>, when Lower Secondary students attend Chapel,
they are to be in full school uniform with their school ties (both boys
and girls). If students have PE on Thursdays, they can be in half-uniform
after their PE lessons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On <strong>Fridays</strong>, which are Dress Down Days, students can be
in half-uniform with any school-related T-shirt.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>All tops, except for the blouse, must be tucked in at all times whether
in full uniform, half-uniform or PE attire.&nbsp;</p>
<p>*Note that the school badge will be presented to the Secondary 1 students
during the Installation Ceremony on <strong>Friday, 9 January 2026</strong>,
and students will receive their name tags by the middle of Term 1 if they
make payment when they purchase their books/stationery from the school
bookshop.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>(C) Locker Arrangement</strong>&nbsp;
<br>All students are issued a locker and students are required to use their
own locks to secure the locker. Students should <strong>bring along a lock on the first day of school</strong> so
that they can secure their belongings. All mobile phones should be kept
in the locker during curriculum time, including recess.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>(D) Secondary 1 3D2N Residential Camp (20 - 22 May 2026)</strong>&nbsp;
<br>The school will be organising a camp for Secondary 1 students as part
of the school’s FLEX programme. It will be held at an external campsite.
Parents / Guardians will receive more information with regards to the camp
via Parents Gateway (PG) at a later date.

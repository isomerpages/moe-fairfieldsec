<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<p><strong>Q1. What is the device that FMS(S) students will be purchasing and what is included in the package?</strong>
<br>iPad 10th Gen 10.9” 64 GB with Apple pencil (USB-C) and casing with attached
keyboard. The device will also come with an enhanced device bundle of 3-year
insurance and a 3-year warranty.</p>
<p><strong>Q2. How much will I have to pay for the device?</strong>
<br>The school will purchase the device on behalf of your child via an MOE
bulk tender. This is done so as to obtain the best value for money. To
ensure the affordability of devices, MOE has provided <strong>Edusave top-ups</strong> of
$200 in 2020 to 2022, and $300 in 2023, to all eligible Singaporean students
in primary and secondary schools. This is on top of the annual $290 credited
into the Edusave account for Secondary School students.</p>
<p>Students who do not have sufficient funds in their Edusave accounts will
need to bear some out-of-pocket expenses for the device (this is not expected
to be a big amount). However, we do not expect many students to be in this
situation.</p>
<p>For students on MOE-FAS, subsidies are available even if there is insufficient
Edusave balance. There will not be out-of-pocket expenses. Subsidies will
be provided for Singapore Citizen students who need support, particularly
those whose Gross Household Income (GHI) is below $4,400 or Per Capita
Income (PCI) is below $1,100.</p>
<p>You can call 6260 0777 to check on your child’s Edusave balance.</p>
<p><strong>Q3. When will my child, who is in Sec 1 2025, be receiving the device?</strong>
<br>Your child should receive his/her device at the start of April 2025. More
details will be shared once the school has more detailed information from
the vendor.</p>
<p><strong>Q4. What happens if the device is damaged / stolen / lost?</strong>
<br>The device comes with 3-year insurance and 3-year warranty, which allows
for two repairs or one replacement. The insurance coverage is only applicable
to situations of damage and loss, even if the student has taken the necessary
precautions to safeguard the device. Do note that loss through negligence
is not covered by insurance. If the replacement of device is no longer
covered by the insurance, the cost of replacement will have to be borne
by the parents/student. FMS(S) can facilitate the purchase of a replacement
device and your child’s Edusave funds can be used, if available, in the
event that this happens.</p>
<p>For lower-income students who need to replace their devices which are
no longer covered by insurance, MOE will provide subsidies to minimise
the out-of-pocket expense.</p>
<p>In the event that your child’s device is faulty, we strongly advise you
to send the device directly to the vendor for troubleshooting and repair,
as the Apple service centres are very accessible and located near MRT stations.</p>
<p>If the device has to be sent in for repair, your child can request to
loan out a similar device (subject to availability) from the school so
that his/her learning will not be interrupted.</p>
<p><strong>Q5. How will the device be used by my child in FMS(S)?</strong>
<br>The device will be used to complement classroom teaching by promoting
active learning and enhancing your child’s schooling experience. Students
can make use of digital productivity tools such as calendaring and note-taking
applications. They will also have greater access to digital platforms,
such as the Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS), to connect, discuss
and collaborate with their peers. The device will allow for greater ownership
in your child’s learning, as they will have greater freedom to explore
the world beyond the classroom and direct their own learning. On days meant
for home-based learning, your child can also benefit from a seamless learning
experience in school and outside of school.</p>
<p>FMS(S) teachers will design our learning programmes to ensure that the
students’ use of PLDs is balanced in relation to other activities and modes
of learning. There is no recommended limit to screen time in class, though
teachers will take note of the amount of time spent on the device during
lessons and balance the time spent on the devices with other activities
such as discussions and physical demonstrations.</p>
<p>Teachers will also continue to ensure that the number of assignments set
(both online and offline) is guided by the school’s homework policy.</p>
<p><strong>Q6. How is the school helping my child to manage the use of the device?</strong>&nbsp;<strong>(E.g. Is there any control over the use of the PLDs to surf irrelevant information online software? Are students allowed to download applications on their PLDs?) How is MOE helping my child to manage possible cyber risks?</strong>
<br>All devices under the initiative will have a Device Management Application
(DMA) installed. The DMA is a software installed in the device to enable
the school and parents to manage and monitor device usage by students.
The DMA would restrict the type of applications and websites accessible
by students and limit the students’ screen time, according to settings
predetermined by the school. For example, inappropriate websites with adult
or extremist content, as well as gaming and gambling websites or applications,
will all be restricted. In addition, the DMA comes with classroom management
capabilities to assist teachers in actively monitoring and controlling
the students’ screens during lesson time for better student management
and effective teaching.</p>
<p>Students will be taught how to embrace the convenience of technology while
maintaining a balanced lifestyle between online and offline activities,
and to be a safe and responsible user of technology in CCE lessons. Peer
support leaders in FMS(S) will also share with the students about being
responsible for their online behavior and well-being, and how to participate
and stay safe as members of online communities. The revised CCE 2021 will
also feature cyber wellness education more strongly, with updated authentic
scenarios used, to better equip students to navigate online spaces safely
and help develop a more supportive cyber environment.</p>
<p><strong>Q7. What is being done to ensure that my child’s device is kept safe in school? Where will students store their devices when they go for recess or PE lessons? Are there charging points for my child to charge the device?</strong>
<br>Lockers have already been provided for our students for them to safe keep
their belongings. Students are expected to secure their devices in their
own lockers when they go for lunch breaks or lessons at other venues in
the school.</p>
<p>To inculcate responsible device usage habits, students should fully charge
their devices at home so that there will not be any unnecessary disruption
to their learning in school.</p>
<p>Students should bring home their device at the end of the school day so
that they can use them for learning at home and also to charge the device
so that it can be used for lessons the next day.</p>
<p><strong>Q8.&nbsp; &nbsp; What happens to the device after my child graduates?</strong>
<br>The school will uninstall the DMA from the device upon students’ graduation,
and students will have full control and personal ownership over their device
afterwards.</p>
<p><strong>Q9. Does my child have a choice not to purchase the device?</strong>
<br>We would strongly encourage all students to purchase the standard device
prescribed by the school, as the model is deemed to be the most suitable
for our learning environment. This is also done to ensure uniformity in
the use of systems and resources which would result in a smooth learning
experience for all the students and teachers.</p>
<p>For students who do not wish to purchase a device because they already
have their own devices will have to check if the device is compatible to
the school’s learning systems (for FMS(S), iPad 10th generation and above).&nbsp;These
devices must also be installed with the school’s Device Management Application
(DMA) software&nbsp;to manage the student’s access and usage.</p>
<p><strong>Q10. How can my child check if his/her own personal device is compatible for use? Will the school provide a checklist of specifications for the student to check on the specifications of their own personal device?</strong>
<br>Please refer to the <a href="/parents/pdlp/compatible-ipad-list/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Compatible iPad List</a> page.</p>
<p><strong>Q11. My child loaned a device from the school for Home-Based Learning (HBL). Can he/she continue to use the loaned device instead of purchasing a new one?</strong>
<br>Students are encouraged to use the device model prescribed by the school
under the PLD initiative, as the uniformity of systems and software would
ensure a smooth learning experience for them. In class, the devices will
be used to support learning of the curriculum subjects independently or
collaboratively. Beyond the classroom, students will be able to use the
device for home-based learning.</p>
<p>Devices purchased under the PLD initiative belong to the students, and
they can continue to use the devices after graduation. For students who
are receiving financial assistance, they will be provided additional subsidies
such that their out-of-pocket expenses for the device will be zero.</p>
<p><strong>Q12.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If my child misses the deadline to make a purchase, can he / she make a purchase later?</strong>
<br>The devices purchased are done at the national level, as such, there are
specific deadlines for purchase so that the schools’ bulk tender can be
fulfilled. If a purchase order did not meet the deadline, the next delivery
could be between 6 months to a year later depending on availability.</p>

### Frequently Asked Questions

**Q1. What is the device that FMS(S) students will be purchasing and what is included in the package?**

  

iPad 10th Gen 10.9” 64 GB with Apple pencil (USB-C) and casing with attached keyboard. The device will also come with an enhanced device bundle of 3-year insurance and a 3-year warranty.

  

**Q2. How much will I have to pay for the device?**

  

The school will purchase the device on behalf of your child via an MOE bulk tender. This is done so as to obtain the best value for money. To ensure the affordability of devices, MOE has provided **Edusave top-ups** of $200 in 2020 to 2022, and $300 in 2023, to all eligible Singaporean students in primary and secondary schools. This is on top of the annual $290 credited into the Edusave account for Secondary School students.

  

Students who do not have sufficient funds in their Edusave accounts will need to bear some out-of-pocket expenses for the device (this is not expected to be a big amount). However, we do not expect many students to be in this situation.

  

For students on MOE-FAS, subsidies are available even if there is insufficient Edusave balance. There will not be out-of-pocket expenses. Subsidies will be provided for Singapore Citizen students who need support, particularly those whose Gross Household Income (GHI) is below $4,000 or Per Capita Income (PCI) is below $1,000

  

You can call 6260 0777 to check on your child’s Edusave balance.

  

**Q3. When will my child, who is in Sec 1 2025, be receiving the device?** 

  

Your child should receive his/her device at the start of April 2025. More details will be shared once the school has more detailed information from the vendor.

  

**Q4. What happens if the device is damaged / stolen / lost?**

  

The device comes with 3-year insurance and 3-year warranty, which allows for two repairs or one replacement. The insurance coverage is only applicable to situations of damage and loss, even if the student has taken the necessary precautions to safeguard the device. Do note that loss through negligence is not covered by insurance. If the replacement of device is no longer covered by the insurance, the cost of replacement will have to be borne by the parents/student. FMS(S) can facilitate the purchase of a replacement device and your child’s Edusave funds can be used, if available, in the event that this happens.

  

For lower-income students who need to replace their devices which are no longer covered by insurance, MOE will provide subsidies to minimise the out-of-pocket expense.

  

The school’s engaged vendor will conduct checks on students’ devices on a regular basis. In the event that your child’s device is faulty, we strongly advise you to send the device directly to the vendor for troubleshooting and repair, as the Apple service centres are very accessible and located near MRT stations. The device can also be left with the school for the vendor to pick up for troubleshooting but this will take a longer turnaround time.

  

If the device has to be sent in for repair, your child can request to loan out a similar device (subject to availability) from the school so that his/her learning will not be interrupted.

  

**Q5. How will the device be used by my child in FMS(S)?**

  

The device will be used to complement classroom teaching by promoting active learning and enhancing your child’s schooling experience. Students can make use of digital productivity tools such as calendaring and note-taking applications. They will also have greater access to digital platforms, such as the Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS), to connect, discuss and collaborate with their peers. The device will allow for greater ownership in your child’s learning, as they will have greater freedom to explore the world beyond the classroom and direct their own learning. On days meant for home-based learning, your child can also benefit from a seamless learning experience in school and outside of school.

  

FMS(S) teachers will design our learning programmes to ensure that the students’ use of PLDs is balanced in relation to other activities and modes of learning. There is no recommended limit to screen time in class, though teachers will take note of the amount of time spent on the device during lessons and balance the time spent on the devices with other activities such as discussions and physical demonstrations.

Teachers will also continue to ensure that the number of assignments set (both online and offline) is guided by the school’s homework policy.

  

**Q6. How is the school helping my child to manage the use of the device?** **(E.g. Is there any control over the use of the PLDs to surf irrelevant information online software? Are students allowed to download applications on their PLDs?) How is MOE helping my child to manage possible cyber risks?**

  

All devices under the initiative will have a Device Management Application (DMA) installed. The DMA is a suite of software installed in the device to enable the school and parents to manage and monitor device usage by students. The DMA would restrict the type of applications and websites accessible by students and limit the students’ screen time, according to settings predetermined by the school. For example, inappropriate websites with adult or extremist content, as well as gaming and gambling websites or applications, will all be restricted. The DMA would also allow the school to remotely download appropriate teaching and learning applications, as well as security patches, into every student’s device. In addition, the DMA comes with classroom management capabilities to assist teachers in actively monitoring and controlling the students’ screens during lesson time for better student management and effective teaching.

  

Students will be taught how to embrace the convenience of technology while maintaining a balanced lifestyle between online and offline activities, and to be a safe and responsible user of technology in CCE lessons. Peer support leaders in FMS(S) will also share with the students about being responsible for their online behavior and well-being, and how to participate and stay safe as members of online communities. The revised CCE 2021 will also feature cyber wellness education more strongly, with updated authentic scenarios used, to better equip students to navigate online spaces safely and help develop a more supportive cyber environment.

  

**Q7. What is being done to ensure that my child’s device is kept safe in school? Where**

**will students store their devices when they go for recess or PE lessons? Are there charging points for my child to charge the device?**

  

Lockers have already been provided for our students for them to safe keep their belongings. Students are expected to secure their devices in their own lockers when they go for lunch breaks or lessons at other venues in the school.

  

To inculcate responsible device usage habits, students should fully charge their devices at home so that there will not be any unnecessary disruption to their learning in school. 

  

Students should bring home their device at the end of the school day so that they can use them for learning at home and also to charge the device so that it can be used for lessons the next day.  

  

**Q8.    What happens to the device after my child graduates?**

  

The school will uninstall the DMA from the device upon students’ graduation, and students will have full control and personal ownership over their device afterwards.

  

**Q9. Does my child have a choice not to purchase the device?**

  

We would strongly encourage all students to purchase the standard device prescribed by the school, as the model is deemed to be the most suitable for our learning environment. This is also done to ensure uniformity in the use of systems and resources which would result in a smooth learning experience for all the students and teachers.

  

For students who do not wish to purchase a device because they already have their own devices will have to check if the device is compatible to the school’s learning systems (for FMS(S), iPad 10th generation and above). These devices must also be installed with the school’s Device Management Application (DMA) software to manage the student’s access and usage.

**Q10. How can my child check if his/her own personal device is compatible for use? Will the school provide a checklist of specifications for the student to check on the specifications of their own personal laptop?**

  

The school will send out detailed information to advise parents on this via the Parents Gateway and School Website in due course.

  

  

**Q11. My child loaned a device from the school for Home-Based Learning (HBL). Can he/she continue to use the loaned device instead of purchasing a new one?**

  

Students are encouraged to use the device model prescribed by the school under the PLD initiative, as the uniformity of systems and software would ensure a smooth learning experience for them. In class, the devices will be used to support learning of the curriculum subjects independently or collaboratively. Beyond the classroom, students will be able to use the device for home-based learning.

  

Devices purchased under the PLD initiative belong to the students, and they can continue to use the devices after graduation. For students who are receiving financial assistance, they will be provided additional subsidies such that their out-of-pocket expenses for the device will be zero.

  

**Q12.     If my child misses the deadline to make a purchase, can he / she make a purchase later?**

The devices purchased are done at the national level, as such, there are specific deadlines for purchase so that the schools’ bulk tender can be fulfilled. If a purchase order did not meet the deadline, the next delivery could be between 6 months to a year later depending on availability.

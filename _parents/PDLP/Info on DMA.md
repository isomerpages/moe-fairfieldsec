<h4>Summary of DMA Settings after School Hours&nbsp;</h4>
<p><em>During school hours, the Default Setting will apply. Parents/Guardians are given a choice to opt for an Alternative Setting, which will apply only to after school hours. The following table outlines the different levels of restrictions, controls and monitoring for the different DMA options after school hours.</em>

<h4>What the different options mean</h4>
<h5>Default</h5>
<p>Default setting treats the iPad as a device which is used for learning
only. The restrictions set in place are derived from the perspective of
how a teacher would want the device to behave in order for the student
to learn in the most desirable environment.&nbsp;The assumption is that
the student will be inclined to use the iPad more as an entertainment device
rather than as a learning device if there are no clear boundaries and control.</p>
<h5>Option A</h5>
<p>Option A provides a hybrid model of allowing parental control after school
hours so that their child’s online behaviour can be managed according to
the parents’ preferences.&nbsp;<strong>However, this option requires the parent to be more savvy with technology, as there are more settings to be managed by the parent.</strong>&nbsp;Choose
this option if you would like to give more opportunities for your child
to explore the cyberworld of online amusement and attractions. Conversely,
you may tighten the controls or shut the iPad down earlier.</p>
<h5>Option B</h5>
<p>Option B gives the student complete freedom in the use of iPad after school.&nbsp;<strong>This option should only be chosen if parents totally trust their child’s handling of the iPad and what they do online.</strong>&nbsp;Ideally,
such a child should be rule-abiding, disciplined and mature enough to control
his/her actions. Without boundaries and control, students may find themselves
glued to their screens and become addicted to the various online games
and videos.</p>
<p><em>*Please note that the Apps purchased (using your personal Apple ID) under options A and B will be hidden and inaccessible during school hours (6.00a.m. - 6.00p.m.)</em>
</p>
<h5>USEFUL TIP</h5>
<p>Parents/Guardians may wish to consider the following questions before
deciding on which After-School DMA Option is best for their child/ward.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>a. Child’s/Ward’s current device usage habits</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>How much time does my child/ward spend on his/her device?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How well is my child/ward able to regulate his/her device usage on his/her
own?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does my child/ward get easily distracted while doing online learning?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>b. Parental/Guardian involvement</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>How confident and familiar am I with managing my child’s/ward’s cyber
wellness?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are there existing routines and open conversations on the use of the internet
at home?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Am I aware of how to prevent different types of cyber threats that my
child/ward might face?</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>After-School DMA Parent Options</h3>
<p>During school hours, the Default Setting will apply.</p>
<p>After school hours, parents/guardians have a choice to continue with the
Default Setting or opt for an Alternative Setting. After-School DMA Parent
Options provide parents with the flexibility in managing your child’s/ward’s
use of PLD after school hours. The following tables provides a brief summary
of each After-School DMA Parent Option.</p>

<p>For parents/guardians who want their child’s/ward’s use of the device
to be restricted only to teaching and learning, and prefer to leave it
to the school to decide on DMA settings after school hours.</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>For parents/guardians who prefer to take charge of the level of restrictions
for their child’s/ward’s use of the device after school hours regulated
by the DMA.</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>For parents/guardians who do not want their child’s/ward’s use of the
device after school hours to be regulated by the DMA at all.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>*No data will be collected after school hours when the DMA is inactive.</p>
<p>Apps purchased (using your personal Apple ID) under Options A and B will
be hidden and inaccessible during school hours (6.00a.m. - 6.00p.m.).</p>
<p>Having default school settings continue after school hours is the best
option for parents/guardians who prefer not to, or do not feel ready to
manage their child’s/ward’s device use on their own.</p>
<p>Parents/guardians can request to change their choice of DMA settings,
which is the existing practice.</p>

controls, and monitoring for each After-School DMA Parent Option, please

<h5>Choosing your DMA Option</h5>
<p>Parents/Guardians may wish to consider the following questions before
deciding on which After-School DMA Option is best for their child/ward.&nbsp;</p>

<li>
<p>How much time does my child/ward spend on his/her device?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How well can my child/ward regulate his/her device usage?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does my child/ward become distracted during online learning?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>b. Parental/Guardian involvement</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Am I familiar with the various cyber threats that my child/ward might
encounter?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are there routines and conversations on the use of the internet at home?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How confident am I in ensuring my child’s/ward’s cyber wellness?</p>

### Compatible iPad list

  

The school strongly recommends that the iPad is purchased through the school to benefit from the 3-year warranty and 3-year insurance. 
  

Parents who opt not to purchase must ensure that their existing iPads meet the following conditions:&nbsp;

•&nbsp;Compatible with Device Management Application (DMA) software&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; Processor: A10 Fusion or better&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; Capacity: 32GB or Higher

&nbsp; &nbsp; OS version: iPadOS 15 or higher

•&nbsp;Must have a compatible stylus and keyboard cover (e.g Apple Pencil, Logitech Ruggedized&nbsp;Combo)

• DMA must be installed on the iPad

• Factory reset will be required (Existing data in the device will be wiped; all personal data must be backed-up)


The table below shows the iPad models that are compatible with DMA software.

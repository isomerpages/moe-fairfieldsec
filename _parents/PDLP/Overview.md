<p>At MOE’s Committee of Supply Debate in March 2020, MOE launched the National
Digital Literacy Programme (<strong>“NDLP”</strong>) for our schools and
Institutes of Higher Learning to help students strengthen their digital
literacy. One of the components of the NDLP is the introduction of the
Personalised Digital Learning Programme (<strong>“PDLP”</strong>) which
places in the hands of secondary school students, a school-prescribed Personal
Learning Device (<strong>“PLD”</strong>) by end-2021.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>The PLD will be used in tandem with the national e-learning platform –
the Singapore Student Learning Space (<strong>“SLS”</strong>) – as well
as other educational technology to personalise and enhance students’ learning.
This will also enable students to acquire digital skills and apply these
skills as they navigate an increasingly digitalised world.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Purchase of PLD bundle</h4>
<p>The PLD bundle which includes warranty and insurance for purchase for
Secondary 1 students in 2025 will be:&nbsp;</p>
<p>iPad 10th Gen&nbsp; 64 GB 10.2-inch with Apple Pencil (USB-C) and casing
with attached keyboard, includes 3-year warranty and insurance</p>
<p>The price of the device bundle (inclusive of GST) is:&nbsp;<strong>S$853.40</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Use of Edusave</h4>
<p>MOE has provided an Edusave top-up of $200 in 2020 to 2022, and $300 in
2023, to all eligible Singaporean students in primary and secondary schools.
This is on top of the annual Edusave contribution of $290 for secondary
students and $230 for primary students. Students who are Singapore citizens
can use their Edusave to pay fully or partly for the PLD, after setting
aside provision for payment of 2nd tier miscellaneous fees. Parents/Guardians
can also choose to pay cash for the PLD.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Financial Assistance</h4>
<p>Subsidies are available for students who require funding support to purchase
a PLD. Please note that it is compulsory for all students on the MOE Financial
Assistance Scheme (FAS) to use their Edusave to pay for the PLD, after
subsidies have been granted. Please see the table below for information
on the eligibility for the subsidy:</p>

<h4>Software Applications</h4>
<h4>IT Applications</h4>
<p>The school will progressively roll out IT applications that will be vital
for teaching and learning. These include:&nbsp;</p>
<p>(a) <strong>Student iCON</strong>: Every student will be provided with
access to the Google Suite set of tools, including email address.
<br>(b) <strong>Microsoft ProPlus</strong>: Every student will be able to use
Microsoft Office tools that include Word, PowerPoint and Excel.&nbsp;
<br>(c) <strong>MS Teams</strong>: Every student will be given a free MS Teams
account for their video conferencing needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The school will need to use students’ full name, Student iCON ID and class
to set up user accounts. The school may also choose to roll out applications
other than those listed above.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Device Management Application</h4>
<p>A Device Management Application (<strong>“DMA”</strong>) will be installed
on all PLDs purchased through the school, and will also be installed on
all student-owned devices after obtaining parental/guardian consent. The
DMA has 3 main components which will support the use of the PLD in the
classroom and safeguard students’ cyber wellness:</p>
<p>(a) Classroom Management Service: This enables teachers to manage the
students’ use of the PLD during lesson time to improve classroom management
and support effective teaching and learning.
<br>b) Mobile Device Management Service: This facilitates the updating and
managing of the PLD, protects the PLD from malicious software, and protects
students from objectionable internet content.
<br>(c) Usage Management Service: This enables the school and/or parents/guardians
to better supervise and set helpful limits for students’ use of PLD after
school.</p>
<h4>Cyber Wellness</h4>
<p>In rolling out the PLD, MOE is aware of concerns regarding students’ cyber
wellness. The DMA allows the school to manage this by:&nbsp;</p>
<p>(a) collecting data on usage by the student, such as the amount of time
spent on each application,&nbsp;
<br>(b) monitoring, filtering and limiting the type of websites accessible
to the student, and
<br>(c) placing restrictions on students’ screen time in order to prevent
cyber addiction.&nbsp;</p>

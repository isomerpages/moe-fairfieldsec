<h3>Personalised Digital Literacy Programme (PDLP)</h3>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>At MOE’s Committee of Supply Debate in March 2020, MOE launched the National
Digital Literacy Programme (<strong>“NDLP”</strong>) for our schools and
Institutes of Higher Learning to help students strengthen their digital
literacy. One of the components of the NDLP is the introduction of the
Personalised Digital Learning Programme (<strong>“PDLP”</strong>) which
places in the hands of secondary school students, a school-prescribed Personal
Learning Device (<strong>“PLD”</strong>) by end-2021.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The PLD will be used in tandem with the national e-learning platform –
the Singapore Student Learning Space (<strong>“SLS”</strong>) – as well
as other educational technology to personalise and enhance students’ learning.
This will also enable students to acquire digital skills and apply these
skills as they navigate an increasingly digitalised world.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Purchase of PLD bundle</h4>
<p>The PLD bundle which includes warranty and insurance for purchase by Secondary
1 students in 2025 will be:&nbsp;
<br>iPad 10th Gen&nbsp;64 GB 10.9-inch with Apple Pencil (USB-C) and casing
with attached keyboard, includes 3-year warranty and insurance.</p>

<p>The price of the device bundle (inclusive of GST) is:&nbsp;<strong>S$853.40</strong>
</p>
<h4>Use of Edusave</h4>
<p>MOE has provided Edusave top-ups of $200 in 2020 to 2022, and $300 in
2023, to all eligible Singaporean students in primary and secondary schools.
This is on top of the annual Edusave contribution of $290 for secondary
students and $230 for primary students. Students who are Singapore citizens
can use their Edusave to pay fully or partly for the PLD, after setting
aside provision for payment of miscellaneous fees. Parents/Guardians can
also choose to pay cash for the PLD.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Financial Assistance</h4>
<p>Subsidies are available for students who require funding support to purchase
a PLD. Please note that it is compulsory for all students on the MOE Financial
Assistance Scheme (FAS) to use their Edusave to pay for any remaining sums
due for the PLD, after subsidies have been granted. Please see the table
below for information on the eligibility for the subsidy:</p>

<p><strong>* PCI</strong>&nbsp;refers to the GHI divided by the total number
of family members in the household.</p>
<h4>Software Applications</h4>
<p>The school will progressively roll out IT applications that will be vital
for teaching and learning. These include:&nbsp;</p>
<p>(a) <strong>Student iCON (Google Workspace)</strong>: Every student will
be provided with access to the Google Suite set of tools, including email
address.
<br>(b) <strong>Microsoft 365 ProPlus</strong>: Every student will be able
to use Microsoft Office tools that include Word, PowerPoint and Excel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The school will need to use students’ full name, Student iCON ID and class
to set up user accounts. The school may also choose to roll out applications
other than those listed above.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Device Management Application</h4>
<p>A Device Management Application (<strong>“DMA”</strong>) will be installed
on all PLDs purchased through the school, and will be installed on devices
that parents/guardians have opted for the student to use in lieu of the
PLD purchased through the school, after parents/guardians have given consent.
The DMA has 3 main components which will support the efficient use of the
PLD in the classroom to enhance students’ learning and safeguard students’
cyber wellness:</p>
<p>(a) Classroom Management Service: To help teachers manage students’ use
of the PLD during lesson time to improve classroom management and support
effective teaching and learning.
<br>
<br>b) Mobile Device Management Service: To help update and manage the PLD,
protect the PLD from malicious software, and protects students from objectionable
internet content.
<br>
<br>(c) Usage Management Service: To enable school and/or parents/guardians
to better supervise and set helpful limits for students’ use of PLD after
school.</p>
<h4>Cyber Wellness</h4>
<p>Parents/guardians may have concerns regarding students’ cyber wellness
with the introduction of the PLD. The DMA allows the school to manage this
by:</p>
<p>(a) collecting data on usage by the student, such as the websites assessed
on the PLD,&nbsp;
<br>(b) monitoring, filtering and limiting the type of websites accessible
to the student, and
<br>(c) placing restrictions on students’ screen time in order to prevent
cyber addiction.&nbsp;</p>

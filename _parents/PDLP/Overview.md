<h3>Personalised Digital Literacy Programme (PDLP)</h3>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>The NDLP was launched at MOE’s Committee of Supply Debate in March 2020
to help students strengthen their digital literacy. One of the components
of the NDLP is the introduction of the Personalised Digital Learning Programme
(“<strong>PDLP</strong>”) for all secondary school students, whereby every
secondary school student will own a school-prescribed PLD. The PLD will
be used together with the national e-learning platform – the Singapore
Student Learning Space (“<strong>SLS</strong>”) – as well as other educational
technology to personalise and enhance students’ learning. This will also
enable students to acquire digital skills and apply these skills as they
navigate an increasingly digitalised world.</p>

<p>The price of the device bundle (inclusive of GST) is: <strong>S$829.30</strong>
</p>
<h4>Use of Edusave</h4>
<p>Students who are Singapore citizens can use their Edusave to pay fully
or partly for the PLD, after setting aside provision for payment of miscellaneous
fees. Parents/Guardians can also choose to pay cash for the PLD. MOE has
provided Edusave top-ups of $200 in 2020 to 2022, and $300 in 2023 to all
eligible Singaporean students in primary and secondary schools. This is
on top of the annual Edusave contribution of $290 for secondary school
students and $230 for primary school students.</p>
<h4>Financial Assistance</h4>
<p>Subsidies are available for students who require funding support to purchase
a PLD. Please note that it is compulsory for all students on the MOE Financial
Assistance Scheme (FAS) to use their Edusave to pay for any remaining sums
due for the PLD, after subsidies have been granted. Please see the table
below for information on the eligibility for the subsidy:</p>

<h4>Software Applications</h4>
<p>The school will progressively roll out IT applications that will be vital
for teaching and learning. These include:&nbsp;</p>
<p>(a) <strong>Student iCON (Google Workspace)</strong>: Every student will
be provided with access to the Google Suite set of tools, including email
address.
<br>(b) <strong>Microsoft 365 ProPlus</strong>: Every student will be able
to use Microsoft Office tools that include Word, PowerPoint and Excel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The school will need to use students’ full name, Student iCON ID and class
to set up user accounts. The school may also choose to roll out applications
other than those listed above.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Device Management Application</h4>
<p>A <strong>DMA </strong>will be pre-installed on all PLDs purchased through
the school and will be installed on devices that parents/guardians have
opted for the student to use in lieu of the PLD purchased through the school,
after parents/guardians have given consent. The DMA has 3 main components
which will support the effective use of the PLD in the classroom to enhance
students' learning and safeguard their cyber wellness:</p>
<p>(a) <u>Classroom Management Service.</u> To help teachers manage students’
use of the PLD during lesson time to improve classroom management and support
effective teaching and learning.
<br>
<br>b) <u>Mobile Device Management Service.</u> To help update and manage the
PLD, protect the PLD from malicious software, and protects students from
objectionable internet content.
<br>
<br>(c) <u>Usage Management Service.</u> To enable school and/or parents/guardians
to better supervise and set helpful limits for students’ use of PLD after
school.</p>
<h4>Cyber Wellness</h4>
<p>Parents/guardians may have concerns regarding students’ cyber wellness
with the introduction of the PLD. The DMA allows the school to manage this
by:</p>
<p>(a) collecting data on usage by the student, such as the websites assessed
on the PLD,&nbsp;
<br>(b) monitoring, filtering and limiting the type of websites accessible
to the student, and
<br>(c) placing restrictions on students’ screen time in order to prevent
cyber addiction.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Devices not purchased through the school</h4>
<p>If parents/guardians choose not to purchase the school-prescribed PLD
bundle (see heading under <strong>Purchase of PLD bundle</strong>) and prefer
that their child/ward use their own computing device (“non-prescribed device”)
in school, that device must have the same Operating System (OS) as the
school-prescribed PLD. The school will verify that the device has the same
OS as the school-prescribed PLD and is compatible with the DMA before approving
it as an alternative to the school-prescribed PLD. Parents will be required
to consent to the installation of the DMA, and the DMA must be installed
in the non-prescribed device, before it can be used in school in lieu of
the school-prescribed PLD.</p>

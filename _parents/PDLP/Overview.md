### Personalised Digital Literacy Programme (PDLP)

  

At MOE’s Committee of Supply Debate in March 2020, MOE launched the National Digital Literacy Programme (**“NDLP”**) for our schools and Institutes of Higher Learning to help students strengthen their digital literacy. One of the components of the NDLP is the introduction of the Personalised Digital Learning Programme (**“PDLP”**) which places in the hands of secondary school students, a school-prescribed Personal Learning Device (**“PLD”**) by end-2021. 

  

#### Overview.

The PLD will be used in tandem with the national e-learning platform – the Singapore Student Learning Space (**“SLS”**) – as well as other educational technology to personalise and enhance students’ learning. This will also enable students to acquire digital skills and apply these skills as they navigate an increasingly digitalised world. 

  

#### Purchase of PLD bundle. 

The PLD bundle which includes warranty and insurance for purchase for Sec 1 students in 2023 will be: 

  

_iPad 9th Gen  64 Gb 10.2-inch with Apple pencil and casing with attached keyboard, includes 3-year warranty and insurance._ 

  

The price of the device bundle (inclusive of GST) is: **S$857.50**

  

#### Use of Edusave.

MOE has provided an Edusave top-up of $200 in 2020, and will provide another Edusave top-up of $200 in May 2021 (as part of the Household Support Package announced in Budget 2021), to all eligible Singaporean students in primary and secondary schools. This is on top of the annual Edusave contribution of $290 for secondary students and $230 for primary students. Students who are Singapore citizens can use their Edusave to pay fully or partly for the PLD, after setting aside provision for payment of 2nd tier miscellaneous fees. Parents/Guardians can also choose to pay cash for the PLD. 

  

#### Financial Assistance. 

Subsidies are available for students who require funding support to purchase a PLD. Please note that it is compulsory for all students on the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS) to use their Edusave to pay for the PLD, after subsidies have been granted. Please see the table below for information on the eligibility for the subsidy:

| Students eligible for subsidy | Income criteria | How to Apply for Subsidy |
|---|---|---|
| Students under MOE FAS | Gross Household Income (“GHI”) is $2,750 or less, or<br>Per Capita Income (“PCI”)* is $690 or less) | No action required. Automatically subsidised for the PLD. |
| Students under School-based FAS | GHI is $4,000 or less, or<br>PCI is $1,000 or less | Approach the school’s General Office to apply for a subsidy. |
| Students who are currently not under the MOE FAS or School-based FAS | GHI is $4,000 or less, or<br>PCI is $1,000 or less | Approach the school’s General Office to apply for a subsidy. |

**\* PCI** refers to the GHI divided by the total number of family members in the household.

#### Software Applications

#### IT Applications.

The school will progressively roll out IT applications that will be vital for students’ teaching and learning. These include: 

(a) **Student iCON**: Every student will be provided with access to the Google Suite set of tools, including email address. <Br>
(b) **Microsoft ProPlus**: Every student will be able to use Microsoft Office tools that include Word, PowerPoint and Excel. <br>
(c) **Zoom**: Every student will be given a Zoom free account with 40 min time limit for their video conferencing needs.  

The school will need to use students’ full name, Student iCON ID and class to set up user accounts. The school may also choose to roll out applications other than those listed above. 

  

#### Device Management Application.

A Device Management Application (**“DMA”**) will come pre-installed on all PLDs purchased through the school, and will be installed on all student-owned devices subject to parental/guardian consent. The DMA has 3 main components which will support the use of the PLD in the classroom and safeguard students’ cyber wellness:

(a) Classroom Management Service. This enables teachers to manage the students’ use of the PLD during lesson time to improve classroom management and support effective teaching and learning. <Br>
b) Mobile Device Management Service. This facilitates the updating and managing of the PLD, protects the PLD from malicious software, and protects students from objectionable internet content.<br>
(c) Usage Management Service. This enables the school and/or parents/guardians to better supervise and set helpful limits for students’ use of PLD after school.

  

#### Cyber wellness.

In rolling out the PLD, MOE is aware of concerns regarding students’ cyber wellness. The DMA allows the school to manage this by: 

(a) collecting data on usage by the student, such as the amount of time spent on each application, <br>
(b) monitoring, filtering and limiting the type of websites accessible to the student, and<br>
(c) placing restrictions on students’ screen time in order to prevent cyber addiction.

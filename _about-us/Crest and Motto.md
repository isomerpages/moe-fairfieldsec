### Crest and Motto

<figure><img src="/images/crest1.png" style="width:30%"></figure>

The emblem of the heart which forms the central motif of the school crest represents the highest of all emotions - love - the love of God for man and the love of man for his neighbour. Surmounting the heart is the torch of knowledge and wisdom which can illuminate the mind and broaden the vision of all who seek its light. Emblazoned in a band of burnished gold across the emblem of the heart is the name of the school; this represents loyalty for the alma mater. The two stars that are at the base of the crest reflect the school motto, “Pure & Honest”, ideals which every student should aspire to attain.

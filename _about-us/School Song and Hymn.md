### School Song and Hymn

#### School Song

A world has opened for us  <br>
A world that's bright and gay<Br>
A world that's full of interest<br>
Since to school we found our way<br>
It's a world that's full of gladness<br>
And we're happy all the day<br>
And we learn that only busy folks<br>
Can be bright and true and gay<Br>
It's at Fairfield, at Fairfield<Br>
Where all the world is bright<br>
Where love is in the sunshine<br>
And our hearts are gay and light<br>
Oh! It's Fairfield, at Fairfield<br>
Where all the world is bright<br>
Where love is in the sunshine<br>
And our hearts are gay and light

  

There we live and work and study<Br>
There we walk in wisdom's ways<br>
Gaining strength for all the future<br>
Far and near we'll sing thy praise<br>
May blessings be upon thee<br>
May many find thy halls<br>
May the leaders of the future<br>
Be found within thy walls<br>
Here's to Fairfield, to Fairfield<br>
To every student here<br>
To every happy fairsian<br>
And to every teacher dear<br>
Oh! It's Fairfield, at Fairfield<br>
Where all our hearts are light<br>
Where love is in the sunshine<Br>
And all the world is bright

#### School Hymn

Bless this school, O Lord we pray  

  

Make it safe by night and day<br>
Bless these pupils, bright and gay<Br>
Keep them out of evil’s way<Br>
Bless the teachers, Lord, we ask<br>
May they find joy in their task<br>
Bless the clerks and servants too<br>
May they serve Thee ever true

  

May we by Thee guided be<br>
From now till eternity<Br>
Bless those who belong to Thee<br>
May they continue to be<br>
Ever faithful, ever kind<br>
Letting God’s light in them shine<br>
Bless us all that we may be<br>
Fit, O Lord, to dwell with thee<Br>
Bless us all that we one day<br>
May dwell, O Lord, with Thee

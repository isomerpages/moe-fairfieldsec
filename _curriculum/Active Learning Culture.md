### Fostering An Active Learning Culture

  

Fairfield is committed to creating a culture of thinking in school. Our pedagogy focuses on getting students to think through thinking routines, questioning techniques and inquiry-based learning. We strive to ignite and sustain students’ interests across various subject disciplines by encouraging deep thinking about the different disciplines. Where appropriate, students are provided authentic contexts for real-world application of their knowledge and skills.

  

We believe that every student wants to and can learn, so we engage the diverse learners through carefully designed experiential learning activities to make their thinking visible. Through consistent feedback and monitoring, students’ learning gaps will be identified and closed. As learning flourishes in caring and safe environments, our teachers are committed to nurturing quality teacher-student relationships to motivate students to enjoy learning.

  

It is our hope that our students will be active life-long learners.

<p>Mdm Naquiah has been involved in the arts since she was five years old.
She enjoys working with youth in the arts the most, as it gives her insight
into ever-changing trends. She has worked on various arts projects, such
as arts and music festivals, both locally and abroad. Above all, teaching
drama holds a special place in her heart. For her, teaching is not only
about imparting knowledge to her students but also about learning from
them to stay relevant. It is always a great honour to be a small part of
their lives through the arts, nurturing the future patrons and practitioners
of the arts industry.

<p>Overview</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Our Vision</strong>
<br>We strongly believe in giving opportunities to all who wish to expend
their creative energy in theatre. Theatre is not meant to be a highbrow
affair for the intellectuals. Theatre is a universal language that speaks
of human condition. Everyone has the right to access and practise this
art that confronts our emotions and analyses our ever-changing world.
<br>
<br><strong>Our Mission</strong>
<br>Our Drama Club helps our students to develop an interest in the performing
arts. There are various opportunities for them to perform in public. Through
our workshops and performance opportunities, we hope to cultivate the aesthetic
sensibilities of young adults and explore themes and issues relevant to
the new generation. We strongly believe in achieving holistic outcomes
for our members and seek to cultivate their life-skills and their personal
character development.
<br>
<br><strong>Our Motto</strong>
<br><strong>F</strong>ocus
<br><strong>E</strong>xcellence
<br><strong>D</strong>iscipline
<br>
<br><strong>History</strong>
<br>Fairfield English Drama was established in year 2003 and we have since
expanded into a 40-member strong CCA. Being student-centric, members are
presented with abundant opportunities to perform and learn the various
aspects of theatre production. The journey at Fairfield English Drama will
develop each member holistically.
<br>
<br><strong>Highlights</strong>
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Sec 1 Drama Training Workshop</strong>
<br>All our secondary one students undergo a 10 weeks drama training workshop
on Wednesday afternoons when they first join the CCA. In this workshop,
students learn the basics of theatre, from acting to the backstage and
the writing of a script. Each cohort would put up a short performance for
their seniors in the Drama club at the end of training workshop.
<br>
<br><strong>Annual Drama Showcase</strong>
<br>In a typical year, our Drama club produces one major production. In the
drama showcase, the audience is treated to various short plays written,
directed, and acted by our very own students. One example is the 2019 showcase,
titled “A Night at the Theatre”.&nbsp;

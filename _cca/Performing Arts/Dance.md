<p><strong>Our Motto</strong>
<br>
</p>
<p>Dance Out Loud
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>History</strong>
<br>
</p>
<p>Fairfield Dance was established in 2004 and has since come a long way.
Its avant-garde contemporary style was shaped by the hands of dance instructors
(Amice Lim and John Mead) who founded John Mead Dance Company. Under Amice
Lim’s tutelage, Fairfield Dance realised the dream of their first ticket-selling
production in NAFA theatre in 2010.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>From 2015, Shir Lyn (Ms Quek) took over and laid the foundation of contemporary
jazz and modern ballet into Fairfield’s style of dancing. Under her leadership,
the team achieved their first SYF Arts Presentation (AP) certificate of
Distinction in International Dance. Shir Lyn continued to raise the dancers’
standards and heighten their passion through participation in prestigious
national competitions like Super 24 and The Royal Dance Off (TRDO). In
2018 and 2020, Fairfield Dancers choreographed and put up their own graduation
recitals, Black Box Volume 1 &amp; 2.

</p>
<p><strong>Highlights</strong>
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Parents’ Night</strong>
<br>
</p>
<p>All parents, in specifically the Secondary One parents, are invited to
a rehearsal cum dialogue session with the teachers and coach at the end
of Term 1. Dancers will share testimonies of their growth in the team.
Parents have the opportunity to understand what the CCA has in store for
their children as well as connect with other parents.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Tumbling Workshop</strong>
<br>
</p>
<p>Dancers will learn rolls, flips, kicks and aerial stunts with guidance
from experienced professionals during our holiday camp trainings. These
skills give dancers an edge in their breakthrough performances in Super
24 and SYF platforms.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Bi-annual Recital: Black Box Series</strong>
<br>
</p>
<p>Our dancers choreograph and put together their very own recital during
non-SYF years. This is a graduation showcase for the Secondary Four and
Five. Features include solo as well as buddy performances with Secondary
One dancers. All dancers are involved in choreography by exploring diverse
themes.

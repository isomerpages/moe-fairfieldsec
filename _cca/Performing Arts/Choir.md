<br><strong>History</strong>
<br>Fairfield Choir is a choir with a rich choral tradition, starting out
in 1960 as a group under the Music Society. In 1975, the choir took part
in National Day Celebrations for the first time and the choristers sang
on board a float decorated by our very own school teachers. In 1977, the
choir clinched the first position in the choral section of the Arts Festival
as well as Youth festival. The choir was also invited to sing at the first
festival of arts in the same year. Although it began as an all girls’ group,
Fairfield Choir became a mixed choir in 1987. With a fine record of several
distinctions, awards in the SYF competition, it was one of the pioneer
choirs in the choral excellence programme in 1988. Since then, the choir
has won many accolades for its stellar performances locally and internationally.
<br>
<br>In 1991, the choir won the coveted “Choir of the Year” award in the 2nd
Singapore Youth Festival competition. It also clinched the “Best Secondary
School Choir” award in 1995 with a Certificate of Distinction. In the subsequent
SYF choral competitions, Fairfield choir was awarded three Silver awards,
four Gold awards, one Gold with Hours award, and three Certifications of
Distinction. Fairfield Choir was also one of the selected choirs to perform
at the Esplanade on 25th July 2005 for the SYF opening ceremony.
<br>
<br>Fairfield Choir had its first overseas trip to Perth, Australia in 1994.
The choir performed at various places to share and spread the good reputation
of Fairfield as a singing school. Using their musical talents as singing
ambassadors for the Lord, Fairfield Choir was awarded Silver awards at
the International Festival of Advent and Christmas Music with Petr Eben’s
Prize held at Czech Republic, Prague, 2002, at the VIII Concorso Corale
In international, Riva del Garda, Italy, 2004 and at the International
Festival of Advent and Christmas Music, Bratislava, Slovakia, 2010. The
choir also achieved the International Gold Zlata award at the 34th International
Festival of Songs, Olomouc, Prague, 2006.
<br>
<br>Fairfield Choir is honoured to have had so many opportunities to showcase
their talents both locally and abroad. Aware of the rich choral legacy
they have to uphold, the choristors put in many hours each week to hone
their abilities. They currently train under the guidance of Mr Yong Chee
Foon and Ms Wynne Lee.

<b>History</b><br><br>

The Boys' Brigade was founded by Sir William Alexander Smith on 4 October 1883 in Glasgow, Scotland. The BB was first introduced to Singapore in 1930 by Mr. James Milner Fraser, and is recognized as a Uniformed Organization by the Ministry of Education. The Patron of the BB in Singapore is none other than His Excellency, the President of the Republic of Singapore.<br><br>

  

The 33rd Singapore Company was first started in Fairfield Methodist Secondary School in 1983, when Fairfield became co-educational. Mr. Jimmy Png was the first Captain of the 33rd Company. Together with a group of Officers and Seniors from the 25th Company, they began to build a new company from scratch. Mr. Wee Tat Chuen assumed leadership of the Company as the Captain in 1996. Under his leadership the Company grew from strength to strength. After being the Captain for 7 years, Mr. Wee passed the baton to Mr. Glen Tan in 2003. Mr. Glen Tan then passed the Captainship to Mr. Joel Li in 2009. In 2015, Mr. Joel Lai took over as Captain. A new 33rd vision was initiated by Mr. Joel Lai - to be a “family of God-fearing Boys, passionate in making a difference.” We currently have about 120 Boys, 10 Officers and 11 Primers.<br><br>

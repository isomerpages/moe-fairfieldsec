<p>Overview</p>
<p><strong>What The 3rd Girls' Brigade Is All About</strong>
<br>
</p>
<p>The Girls' Brigade is an international, interdenominational Christian
youth organisation for girls&nbsp;which was first established in Singapore
in 1927. The 3rd Company was started ten years later in Fairfield Methodist
Girls' School, now known as Fairfield Methodist School. The 3rd Company
has provided many girls from the ages of 9 to 16-year olds with valuable
experiences and interactions. Even till this day, many of the graduated
seniors still feel a sense of commitment to come back to the school to
help out with the various activities in the company.
<br>
</p>
<p>The Girls' Brigade serves also as a platform for girls to develop in character
and hone their leadership skills through the annual camps and events organised
for the girls and the GB sessions. Our activities aim to fulfil the four
-fold programme of the Girls' Brigade, to nurture our girls to be adept
educationally, spiritually, socially, as well as physically, preparing
them to make a difference in society.
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Vision:</strong>
<br>To make every girl a Leader!
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Aim:</strong>
<br>To help our girls to become faithful followers of the Lord Jesus Christ
and through self control, reverence and a sense of responsibility, find
true enrichment of life.
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Motto:</strong>&nbsp;
<br>Seek, serve and Follow Christ.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Principles:</strong>
<br>The Brigade acknowledges Jesus Christ as Saviour and Lord according to
the scriptures and seeks to fulfil its Aim to the glory of one God, Father,
Son and Holy Spirit.
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>What We Do:</strong>&nbsp;
<br>The Brigade witnesses to the standard set by Jesus Christ and gives positive
teaching on the Christian attitude to life, and promotes a just society
where all people are equally valued.
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Our Badge</strong>
<br><strong>A Cross</strong>&nbsp;in the centre is the symbol of Christ and
his church.
<br><strong>A Lamp</strong> at the bottom signifies our hope for His glory
to shine out upon the world through us.
<br><strong>A Torch</strong>&nbsp;at the top, is the flame of love, of Christ's
living Spirit and of our devotion to Him.
<br><strong>A Crown</strong>&nbsp;at the base of the Torch, symbolises our
recognition of Christ as our King.
<br>The&nbsp;<strong>Red Background</strong>&nbsp;signifies the blood of Jesus,
which washes away all sins.
<br>Lastly, the&nbsp;<strong>Blue Circle</strong>&nbsp;represents God's never-ending
love for us.
<br>

<p><strong>Our Vesper</strong>
<br>
</p>
<p>Captain Divine,
<br>
</p>
<p>Our work is now complete
<br>
</p>
<p>And ere we part,
<br>
</p>
<p>We gather at thy feet
<br>
</p>
<p>To give our labours and ourselves to Thee
<br>
</p>
<p>Without reserve, Thy cause to serve
<br>
</p>
<p>O Captain hear us as we pledge to be
<br>
</p>
<p>True to our creed
<br>
</p>
<p>In thoughts and deeds
<br>
</p>
<p>Amen.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Activities</strong>
<br>
</p>
<p>We meet almost every week on Fridays at 2.15pm as a way to conclude the
stressful week.
<br>
</p>
<p>No matter how bad a day a day the girls may have, they can cast aside
their worries for that&nbsp;moment. Our programme seeks to develop the
girls in four important aspects as mentioned above.
<br>
</p>
<p>We have devotion (spiritual), drill (physical), badgework (educational)
and&nbsp;recreation (social), comprising of fun games to build teamwork.
Our girls are grouped into&nbsp;squads where they develop and interact
with one another, forging new friendships.
<br>
</p>
<p>Our 3rd(S) company has about 90 girls who are grouped into 6 squads in
total.
<br>
</p>
<p>The best way to enjoy GB sessions is to not think of it as just a CCA
but as an experience that you&nbsp;will never be able to have once you
graduate out of secondary school, having friends that will&nbsp;always
be there to catch you when you fall, especially during the camps, where
your friendships&nbsp;are strengthened and the friends by your side make
it more enjoyable.</p>

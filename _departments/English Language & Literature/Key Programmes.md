#### Voice of a Fairsian Programme

The English department’s four-year ‘Voice of A Fairsian Programme’ builds students’ confidence in public speaking and develops their advocacy and writing skills by exposing students to a variety of texts and themes. Through debates, dramatic performances, presentations, talk shows, multi-media projects and e-audio picture books, students exercise their creativity, deepen their analysis and discover their personal voice to respond to the world we live in.

#### Community Problem Solving Project  

One of the department’s signature programmes, the Community Problem Solving Project hones students’ critical and inventive thinking, communication abilities, and collaborative and information skills by applying divergent and convergent thinking in teams to solve a significant problem faced by a community. This project combines research, writing and presentation skills, and offers an avenue for students to deepen their understanding of communities to become empathetic and caring citizens.

  

#### Literature ‘Watch A Play’ Programme

Excursions to the theatre are organised for Literature students to expose students to theatre arts to heighten their appreciation for the arts and cultivate in them a love for the performance of literary works. This will in turn help them better appreciate the dramatic techniques used after experiencing what it is like to be an audience in an authentic theatre setting.

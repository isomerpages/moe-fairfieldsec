### Key Programmes

#### Voice of a Fairsian Programme

The English department’s four-year ‘Voice of A Fairsian Programme’ cultivates students’ confidence in public speaking and advocacy skills. This programme, which consists of engaging language-focused activities like debate, drama, speech and oral presentations, enable students to develop the ability to form sound opinions through thorough analysis and deep reflection; articulate, persuade and convince others appropriately; and muster the courage to speak up, stand up for and act upon one’s views and beliefs – and hence, grow a stronger personal voice.

#### Community Problem Solving Project  

One of the key highlights for Secondary Three students is the Community Problem Solving Project. For a duration of two terms, students work in groups of four to five to create a solution for an authentic problem faced by the Fairfield community and a community that they have identified beyond Fairfield. This project hones the students’ critical and inventive thinking, communication abilities, collaborative and information skills, which are key competencies required in the 21st Century.

  

Applying the rigour of divergent and convergent thinking in their teams, students work on a series of comparative evaluation to arrive at the most significant problem and most effective solution, before presenting their final research findings and detailed analysis to their peers and teachers. After that, the best projects from each class are considered for actual implementation and follow through. This is a signature project of the English department that aims to make learning and problem solving as real and authentic as possible for the students.

  



  

#### Sec 1 to 4 ‘Watch A Play’ Programme

To help Literature students understand and engage with their Literature texts more successfully, excursions to the theatre are organised for them. We hope that this will increase their appreciation for the Arts and inculcate in them a love for the performance of literary works.

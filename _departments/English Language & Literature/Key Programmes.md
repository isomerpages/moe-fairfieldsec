#### Voice of a Fairsian Programme

The English department’s four-year ‘Voice of A Fairsian Programme’ builds students’ confidence in public speaking and develops their advocacy and writing skills by exposing students to a variety of texts and themes. Through debates, dramatic performances, presentations, talk shows, multi-media projects and e-audio picture books, students exercise their creativity, deepen their analysis and discover their personal voice to respond to the world we live in.

  

#### Literature ‘Watch A Play’ Programme

Excursions to the theatre are organised for Literature students to expose students to theatre arts to heighten their appreciation for the arts and cultivate in them a love for the performance of literary works. This will in turn help them better appreciate the dramatic techniques used after experiencing what it is like to be an audience in an authentic theatre setting.

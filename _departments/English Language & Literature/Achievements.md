### Achievements

#### 2018 YMCA Plain English Speaking Awards (PESA)

#### 2018 National Schools Literature Festival 

On 21 July 2018, two teams of Literature students represented Fairfield at the National Schools Literature Festival. Over 2000 participants from over 120 schools attended the event held at Paya Lebar Methodist Secondary School. A team of eight students participated in the lower secondary book trailer category, and a team of four Secondary 3 students participated in the Upper Secondary Unseen Text Debate. This was meant to expose students to how Literature is taught and presented in other schools, and to allow them to learn from other students about different modes of performances and genres of Literature. It also allows them to challenge themselves and pit their skills against stronger competitors so that they can always improve and be a better version of themselves. Both teams came in first in their competition rooms at the National Schools Literature Festival.

#### Achievements in Writing Competitions

The English Language department also actively hones our students’ writing skills and establishes strategic partnerships with relevant organisations to find competition platforms to help them excel in various prestigious writing competitions like ‘The Queen’s Commonwealth Essay Competition’ as well as the ‘Safety Starts with Me Creative Story Writing Competition’. 

  

Through the close guidance of our English Language teachers, students gain the intellectual experience to not only broaden their writing experience, but also pit their writing skills and creativity against the very best local and international writers. 

  

Fairfield is proud of the achievements of the following talented and creative young writers who delivered prize-winning masterpieces after seizing the unique opportunity to make their voice heard on both the local and global platforms.

#### Achievements in Scrabble Competitions 

Taking part in Scrabble competitions is a new endeavour that a handful of Secondary One students initiated in 2018. It all started with three students who took part in Scrabble competitions while they were in primary school, who expressed their desire to join the secondary school Scrabble competitions. They roped in their classmates and friends to form teams, to great success. Scrabble is a great platform to hone students’ strategic thinking skills and to draw on and expand their extensive vocabulary.

### Achievements 

#### Achievements in Writing Competitions

The English Language department also actively hones our students’ writing skills and establishes strategic partnerships with relevant organisations to find competition platforms to help them excel in various prestigious writing competitions like ‘The Queen’s Commonwealth Essay Competition’ as well as the ‘Safety Starts with Me Creative Story Writing Competition’.&nbsp;

  

Through the close guidance of our English Language teachers, students gain the intellectual experience to not only broaden their writing experience, but also pit their writing skills and creativity against the very best local and international writers.&nbsp;

In recognition of the budding talents in public speaking among Fairsians, the English Language Department identifies and registers students to participate in national and inter-school public speaking competitions such as the YMCA Plain English Speaking Awards (PESA) and National Public Speaking Competition (NPSC) every year.

Students are given close guidance in writing their own original speeches for the competitions, and they receive feedback on how to improve and prepare for the competitions.

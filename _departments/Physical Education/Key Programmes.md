#### Sec 2 Fairfield Learning Experience (FLEX) Week

The school adopts a holistic approach towards imbuing in the students an adventurous spirit and a love for outdoor education. All Secondary 2 students are given the opportunity to spend 4 Days 3 Nights at an outdoor campsite for an expeditionary programme that consists of outdoor cooking, tent pitching, as well as land & sea expeditions.

  

The objectives of the course are aligned to the Social-Emotional Learning (SEL) Framework (MOE, 2005), in which the five key learning outcomes of the course are:

  

**a) Self Awareness** \- Act responsibly to oneself, others and the environment.  
**b) Self Management** \- Understand the key factor of contributing to teamwork.  
**c) Social Awareness** \- Recognise the need for perseverance in completing tasks.  
**d) Relationship Management** \- Learn to deal with unfamiliar tasks and challenges.  
**e) Responsible Decision Making** \- Realise the importance of evaluation and reflection.

  

In the process, these objectives are met when pupils learn about their own strengths and weaknesses; the importance of mental tenacity; and effective leadership skills in overcoming the challenges posed to them. The experiential course is also aimed at facilitating social bonding among the pupils, further enhance their life skills as well as to develop their character.

  

#### PEDAL (PE Departmental Assessment of Learning

Pupils at various levels are assessed in the cognitive, affective and psychomotor domains via the sports module, the level of fitness and weight status. These sports modules cover popular games from the 3 categories: Striking games, Territorial Games and Net-Barrier Games and pupils are assessed based on their mastery of the below games:

  

Sec 1- Swimming (Swimsafer 2.0) /Volleyball

Sec 2- Basketball

Sec 3- Softball

Sec 4- Badminton

  

#### Inter-class Games/Sports Leadership

The Inter-class Games provide a platform for the pupils to bond as a class and to demonstrate their understanding and confidence in newly acquired games skills and knowledge from the PE curriculum.



  

The pupils from Sec 1 to 4 are encouraged to participate in 4 games, namely Volleyball (Sec 1), Basketball/Captains Ball (Sec 2), Softball (Sec 3) , Ultimate Frisbee (Sec 4).

  

The Inter-class Games also serve as a platform for Class Captains to develop into confident and competent Sports Leaders, through the organisation and execution of the Games. Other opportunities of development involving our partners are also provided to the Class Captains, namely the Fairfield Methodist School (Primary) Sports Carnival, and the Telok Blangah CC – FMSS Family Affairs on Bicycle. It is believed that such opportunities will enrich the pupils’ experience and provide them a platform to apply and hone their leadership capability.

  

#### FAIRFIELD ANNUAL RUN

The Annual Run (formerly known as Cross Country) is an annual event organised in conjunction with the Healthy Lifestyle Week. On that day, the entire school community gathers at a community park for a competitive run around the scenic grounds. The event aims to imbibe the importance of healthy living and to cultivate the spirit of resilience and determination. It also provides an informal setting for teachers to mingle with parents, strengthening the home-school partnership.

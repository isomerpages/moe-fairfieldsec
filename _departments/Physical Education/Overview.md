<img src="/images/Dept Photos/physical education department 2.jpg" style="width:80%">

The PE department is a team of energetic and passionate educators who advocate continuously living active lifestyles. We firmly believe that Sports and Physical Education is an avenue for developing active lifelong learners and influential leaders of sterling character. We seek to equip Fairsians with the attitudes, knowledge and skills to pursue healthy lifestyles, in which core values such as resilience, teamwork, honesty and respect for others are evidently displayed through their involvement in sports.

#### Mission: PE for Life

Our vision is to empower our students with the desired physical skills and values to develop routines and habits for pursuing an active and healthy lifestyle through personal and corporate engagement.

  

The Physical Education (PE) curriculum comprises three learning areas: (i) Outdoor Education, (ii) Physical Activities, and (iii) Physical Health and Fitness. In the Outdoor Education module, students learn a variety of outdoor skills such as outdoor cooking and tent pitching. Students also build on the foundation of orienteering in the Sec 1 adventure camp where they are challenged to trek and kayak for more than ten kilometres for both the land and sea expeditions. Students are exposed to a range of Physical Activities that include net-barrier, striking-fielding and territorial-invasion games. These Physical Activities develop the studentsâ€™ gross motor skills and promote muscular coordination. Through Physical Health and Fitness, students learn how to manage their caloric intake, body-mass-index, pacing etc. with a variety of theory and practical lessons.

#### Our Approach to Learning

Our qualified and trained PE teachers are dedicated to delivering a quality and holistic educational experience that caters to the differentiated learning needs. Opportunities are created for students to experience and enjoy a range of competitive and challenging activities as individuals, partners and/or in teams while regular, timely feedback and assessment help students monitor and improve their own fitness/skill levels. We seek to instil a lifelong enjoyment and appreciation of PE and sport, and develop an understanding of how PE and sport are useful and needed for a balanced and healthy lifestyle.

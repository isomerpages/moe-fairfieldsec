### Key Programmes

The learning of Science is crafted in a progressive fashion where learning activities are learner-centric, inquiry-based and authentic:

#### 1\. Secondary One Community Garden project

The Community Garden project involves all academic streams of our Secondary One students and integrates the learning from various topics from our customised Secondary One Science curriculum, in alignment to the Thematic Approach to Science. It seeks to foster an active thinking culture amongst all students. Students will appreciate that Science is not just confined to the classroom or laboratory but also to the natural world where interaction between living things and its environment are essential. At the same time, students will become socially responsible by caring for others through meaningful contribution to the local community with the products from the Community Gardens.

  

#### 2\. Secondary Two Enrichment

The Secondary Two enrichment programme serves as an extension to the curriculum that students are learning in the classroom, by allowing students to see how different Science concepts and learning are integrated in authentic application of Science learning.

  

#### 3\. Secondary Three Physics/Chemistry/Biology enrichment

Students experience in depth how the Physics or Chemistry topics they have learnt in the classroom are applied in a hands-on and authentic context. They apply their scientific knowledge such as building a solar cooker in Physics, investigate the authentic applications of rate of reaction in Chemistry, or learning journeys to Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum in Biology.


  

#### 4\. Science National Competitions

Fairsians who have strong inclination in Science can participate in various Science National Competitions. The Science Programme for Education of Aspiring Researchers, or SPEAR, is set up to allow Fairsians to develop a passion in science by allowing them to explore their areas of interest outside the curriculum. Students conduct different projects from a wide range of topics, and subsequently submitted their projects for competitions such as the Singapore Science and Engineering Fair. Upper secondary students talented in the various Science subjects also participate in the Biology, Chemistry and Physics Junior Olympiads.

#### Vision

To answer the MOE’s call of Science for Life and Society, the Science Department in Fairfield aims to nurture active, lifelong learners through a differentiated and learner-centric curriculum that develops in-depth understanding of major Science concepts and theories, as well as high-level proficiency through opportunities for advanced study.

  

We achieve this vision by inspiring Fairsians to be curious and develop an inquiring mind through authentic and engaged learning. We nurture in students logical reasoning and analytical skills to make sense of the world around them.

  

#### Science Department’s Teaching and Learning Approach

The department’s approach to the teaching and learning of Science (Fig. 1) is guided by the revised MOE’s Science Curriculum Framework

The department adopts different approaches to nurture a vibrant community of lifelong learners. We work on the different themes and disciplines in Science while integrating values and 21 st century competencies to address the holistic development of students. We also customise, plan or select lessons, programmes and competitions that are experiential and progressive, leveraging on our partners to provide enriched learning for our students and teachers.

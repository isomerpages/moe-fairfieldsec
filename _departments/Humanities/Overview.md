“The Humanities Department in Fairfield strives to help our students gain a critical understanding and appreciation of both the human and physical worlds.

  

Being future-oriented, the department adopts current learner-centred pedagogies that equip our students with 21st Century competencies and teachers actively impart core values to all learners.

  

Through our passion for the Humanities, we strive to inspire our students to recognise their roles as ‘global’ citizens who contribute to society and the environment.”

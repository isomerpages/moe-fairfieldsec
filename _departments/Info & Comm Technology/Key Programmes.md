### Key Programmes

#### (a) Use of ICT in Teaching and Learning

In the idea of ‘technology-transformed learning’, there is a fundamental shift in educational approaches, where educators leverage modern digital tools and platforms to enhance the learning experience.

For example:

**a)	Collaborative digital platforms:** Students work on projects together in real-time, regardless of physical location, using cloud-based tools and video conferencing eg. Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, Zoom.

**b)	Gamification of learning:** Educational content is presented in game-like formats to increase engagement and motivation through challenges, rewards, and progress tracking eg. Kahoot, Quizziz, Blooket.

**c)	Anytime, anywhere learning:** Students can access educational content and complete assignments from any location eg. viewing video lessons, completing assignments on SLS and Google Classroom.

#### (b) Programming Workshops @ Learning Festival

Secondary 1 and 2 students participate in programming workshops such as the Microbit Programming Workshops organised in 2024 for Secondary 1 and 2 students. Coding and programming workshops equip students with valuable technical skills and enhance their problem-solving abilities, creativity, and digital literacy. These experiences not only prepare students for potential careers in technology but also boost their confidence and foster an innovative mindset applicable across various disciplines.

#### (c) Drone Programming @ Secondary 3 FLEX

In the Fairfield Learning Experience Week (FLEX) Challenge that the Secondary 3 cohort embarks on annually, one of the challenges available to students is Drone Programming. This offers students hands-on experience with cutting-edge technology, combining coding skills with real-world applications. The Drone Programming FLEX challenge enhances students' understanding of robotics, spatial awareness, and physics while fostering creativity and problem-solving in an engaging, practical context that can spark interest in STEM fields and emerging career opportunities.

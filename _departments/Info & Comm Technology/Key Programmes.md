### Key Programmes

#### (a) Create & Construct using Information Technology Programme (CCITP)

The school seeks to empower pupils to create and construct their learning in an environment that promotes creativity and innovation with seamless integration of IT. FMS(S) leverages on IT to cater to the varying needs of the wide range of abilities of pupils as well as to support the school vision and mission.

  

Secondary 1 and 2 students undergo a weekly hour-long IT lesson. During these lessons, they are taught to use a variety of software such as Google suite of tools and Microsoft office tools. Students are also given an opportunity to explore coding with the use of Scratch and Microbit. These lessons enrich their understanding and use of IT.

  

#### (b) Use of ICT in Teaching and Learning

Besides the traditional way of learning by means of pen and paper, FMS(S) also includes the use of online resources as a form of teaching and learning. Our teachers enhance students’ learning by using different online tools, such as Zoom, Google Meet, discussion forums and the Student Learning Space (SLS).

  

Online learning not only helps to develop the students’ ability to collaborate on a different platform but more importantly, teaches them how to communicate and work with others offline and online as well.

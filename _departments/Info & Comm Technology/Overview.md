### Information &amp; Communication Technology
In the current climate of technological innovation and development of educational technology (EdTech), the possibilities for harnessing ICT for teaching and learning experiences that are more meaningful, effective and engaging are endless.

The Ministry of Education (MOE) has launched the “Transforming Education through Technology” Masterplan 2030 or [EdTech Masterplan 2030](https://www.moe.gov.sg/education-in-sg/educational-technology-journey/edtech-masterplan)  for short, which outlines how schools can better leverage technology to enhance teaching and learning.



#### Vision for EdTech:

**Students:** Self-directed learners empowered with digital literacies and competencies to thrive in a technology-transformed future

**Staff:** Collaborative lesson designers empowered with e-pedagogy to harness technology for engaged T&L

Over the next few years, we will be embarking on various initiatives and implementations in line with the EdTech Masterplan 2030 to achieve this vision.

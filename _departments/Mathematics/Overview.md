### Mathematics

<img src="/images/Dept Photos/mathematics department 2.jpg" style="width:80%">

With a group of committed and passionate teachers, the department aims to provide our students with a strong foundation in mathematical concepts and skills that will help them to solve real life problems and pursue further interest in Mathematics. We also aim to develop in our students a positive attitude towards the learning of Mathematics so that they will be resilient and confident in solving mathematical problems.

  

The department incorporates Polya's Problem Solving Framework into its teaching and learning, where students are taught process in problem solving. Flipped learning and e-learning are part of mathematics teaching and learning. Through these, students cultivate self-directed learning (SDL) skills in their learning of mathematics concepts, and teachers have more opportunities to further enhance their studentsâ€™ learning. The department includes activities and tasks that promote collaboration as well as independent learning amongst students. Students go through learning experiences to enhance their reasoning and communication skills. These include going out of the classrooms to investigate and record findings, as well as sharing their learning experiences with the rest of their classmates. Students also experience lessons that involve the use of technology to explore and construct their own learning and in the process, learn to use various information and communications technology tools that will help them to strengthen their conceptual understanding.

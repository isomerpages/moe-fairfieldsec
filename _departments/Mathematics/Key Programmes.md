Students who are competent in Mathematics are given opportunities to participate in weekly Mathematics Olympiad trainings as part of the Mathematics enrichment programme. The training is customised for our students based on the following objectives:  

  

*   To develop higher-order thinking skills through solving challenging mathematical problems
*   To stimulate critical thinking in Mathematics
*   To provide deeper insights into challenging Mathematical problems
*   To prepare for Mathematical Olympiad Competition / Mathematics Competition

After a year of training, all participants will represent the school in the annual Singapore Mathematics Olympiad Competition organised by National University of Singapore. Our students have been doing well in the competition, being awarded the silver and bronze medals as well as the honourable mention.

<p>Founder’s Day, held annually on 4 August, is celebrated by staff and students,
commemorating the rich and colourful history of Fairfield and its founder,
Miss Sophia Blackmore. This year marked the school’s 137th Founder’s Day,
with a heartfelt service in the Chen Su Lan Hall.</p>
<p>The programme began with a moving performance by the Fairfield Guitar
Ensemble as they played a rendition of Bless the Lord by Matt Redman to
remind Fairsians about God's goodness and blessings over the school’s long
history. They played gracefully, leaving the audience with a strong sense
of appreciation for Fairfield’s journey.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Reverend Timothy Ang then led the congregation in prayer, blessing the
school and its community with words of encouragement. This was followed
by an invitation from the upper secondary Chapel Band, as they led the
school in worship. Soon after, our Principal, Mr Wee Tat Chuen, shared
stories about events leading up to Founder’s Day. His words echoed through
the hall, prompting students to reflect on their time in Fairfield.</p>
<p>The highlight of the service came with an address by the Guest of Honour,
Dr Low Guat Tin, a distinguished educator who shared her insights on God's
love and a heartwarming testimony about kindness, inspiring many who heard
it.</p>
<p>Finally, the Fairfield Choir performed Sunshine in My Soul by Burl Ives,
the School Hymn (Bless This School), and the Fairfield School Song. Their
unison voices lifted the spirits of everyone in the hall, as we were reminded
of the blessings we had received from the ones who came before us.</p>
<p>As the celebration drew to a close, it was clear that the Founder’s Day
service embodied the enduring legacy of our school and the values we are
called to live out. May all Fairsians continue to honour this rich heritage
with faith!</p>

<h1><strong>Striving for excellence: Blackmore Leadership Training Camp 2025</strong>&nbsp;</h1>
<p><em>By: Fayth Wai (3E) and Goh Yu Qian (3G)</em>
</p>
<p>As part of Fairfield’s Sophia Blackmore Leadership Programme (SBLP), the
school organises key initiatives to nurture influential leaders — anchored
in values and skilled in the 4 Fairfield leadership practices: <em>Modeling Purity &amp; Honesty, Encouraging Hearts, Enabling Unity, Stewarding Growth, Strengthening Resilience and Inspiring Peaks of Excellence.</em>
</p>
<p>Among these, the prestigious annual Blackmore Leadership Training Camp
(BLTC) holds a special place. Held on 3 and 4 June this year, a total of
61 Secondary Three Student Leaders from the Student Council and CCAs, participated
in this event at the MOE Labrador Outdoor Adventure Learning Centre. Over
the two days, the camp fostered a spirit of excellence and unity among
the Secondary Three leaders.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the first day, the students engaged in a modified scavenger hunt, which
allowed them to have conversations about the leadership practices they
have been learning. The day ended with a grand cook-off. As the sun set,
the air was filled with the scents of freshly grilled meat, fragrant garlic
and thick smoke—signs of every leader labouring over their creations. As
night fell, they gathered for reflection and paused to examine the values
they cherished and the lessons they had learnt.</p>
<p>On the second day, the student leaders travelled to Sentosa for the ‘Camp
Challenge’ team activities. Students embarked on multiple team challenges,
putting on their thinking hats to build their own raft with the materials
their group had previously obtained. Through this activity, the student
leaders learnt to work together under pressure. The next activity was a
River Crossing Challenge, where leaders had to come up with a strategy
to cross the river. The leaders put aside their differences in order to
come to the final agreement. Although the task proved challenging, the
leaders gained deep insights into unity and perseverance— lessons far more
enduring than any trophy could offer.</p>
<p>Lastly, the camp concluded with its most poignant activity: an act of
servant leadership— washing each other’s feet. This is a reflection of
one of history’s most recognised stories where Jesus washed the feet of
his disciples. Laughter and gratitude wafted through the air, making the
atmosphere noticeably warmer than it was during Day One.</p>
<p>By the end of the BLTC, it was evident that the camp had united the cohort.
The leaders discovered what it means to lead with both strength and heart.&nbsp;</p>

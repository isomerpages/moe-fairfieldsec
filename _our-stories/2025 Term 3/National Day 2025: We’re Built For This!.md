<h1>National Day 2025: We’re Built For This!&nbsp;</h1>

<p><strong><em>Majulah Singapura</em></strong>, the theme of SG60. A short
phrase meaning <em>'Onward Singapore</em>' in Malay, representing a nation,
a community, and a society. On 8 August 2025, Fairfield came together,
dressed in red and white, excited to commemorate Singapore's 60 years of
independence, enduring spirit and aspirations. The event was a colourful
mosaic of performances, from singing iconic past National Day songs to
watching the exhilarating performance by the National Cadet Corps (Land).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The morning began with the solemn marching of the Uniform Groups into
the parade square. The Fairfield Symphonic Band then proceeded to perform
a rendition of <em>Where I Belong</em> by Tanya Chua. Following that, students
sang the national anthem and recited the pledge loudly and proudly as representatives
from the Uniform Groups raised the national flag.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The celebrations continued in the Chen Su Lan Hall with a play by Fairfield
Drama, portraying the events and emotions of Singaporeans before independence
in 1965. This paved the way for the Precision Drill Squad from National
Cadet Corps (Land) to march onto the stage, giving a mesmerising performance
that enthralled the audience. Throwing their guns into the air and catching
them in sharp, slick moves, they synchronised perfectly with the music.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A more personal glimpse of SG60 came through a video curated by Media@Fairfield,
in which students, teachers and staff expressed their 60 hopes for Singapore
to celebrate SG60. The video gave the Fairfield family time to reflect
on what the nation meant to them.</p>
<p>Finally, the long-awaited concert segment began. It started with a game
of <em>Don't Forget The Lyrics</em>, where students had to guess the lyrics
of fan favourites, such as <em>Where I Belong</em>. Next, the teachers'
band took the stage, with a mesmerising electric guitar solo of <em>Count On Me</em> by
Mr Ezal, captivating the audience. Following that, they played a beautiful
rendition of <em>The Road Ahead</em>, originally by Linying, Sezari, Shye
and Shabir, and <em>Not Alone</em> by Benjamin Kheng, invoking a sense of
patriotism in everyone. The concert segment reached its emotional peak
with the iconic National Day song<em> Home </em>by Kit Chan, touching the
hearts of many Fairsians.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From thrilling displays to entertaining games, this was an exhilarating
National Day celebration. Through this lively event, Fairsians celebrated
this significant milestone together, proudly uniting as one school to express
their gratitude for Singapore.&nbsp;</p>

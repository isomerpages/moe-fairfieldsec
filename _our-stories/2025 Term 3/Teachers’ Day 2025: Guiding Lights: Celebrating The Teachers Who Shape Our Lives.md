<h2><strong>Teachers’ Day 2025: Guiding Lights: Celebrating The Teachers Who Shape Our Lives</strong></h2>

<p>At Fairfield Secondary, Teachers' Day is more than just a date on the
calendar; it is a cherished occasion that unites Fairsians and teachers
in celebration and gratitude. It is a day to honour the dedication, patience,
and love that teachers pour into every lesson, student, and moment shared
throughout the year. Held on 4 September 2025, our Teachers' Day celebration
centred on the theme of ‘Constellations’. Just as stars guide those who
are lost, teachers light our paths when we feel uncertain and lead us towards
brighter futures.</p>
<p>Meticulously planned by Fairfield's Student Leaders, the Teachers' Day
concert kicked off with the arrival of teachers to the hall, where they
were greeted by waves of excited cheers and applause from students who
filled the space with energy and joy. The Fairfield Symphonic Band opened
with a captivating performance, delighting the audience with their rendition
of the Yoasobi Medley. The melodies wove a message of gratitude and warmth,
reminding every teacher of the love and dedication they have given their
students. This was followed by a heartwarming 'Thank You' video prepared
by the students.</p>
<p>Another highlight came from the Guitar Ensemble's performance of 《新衣哪有旧衣好》,
a Chinese folk song that loosely translates to 'New clothes can never replace
the old'. The song symbolises how memories shared between teachers and
students — like cherished garments — are timeless, warm, and irreplaceable.</p>

<p>Laughter soon filled the hall with an interactive game segment that had
both students and teachers on their feet. Six teachers competed in a lively
object-hunt game, racing to find items announced by the host and then returning
to the stage within the time limit. With each frantic dash and cheer from
the crowd, the hall buzzed with excitement.</p>
<p>The musical celebration continued with more performances and culminated
in a Secondary 4 student band, Soufflé, performing Beaches. The gentle
melody lingered in the air like waves upon the shore — a fitting metaphor
for teachers, who serve as safe harbours offering comfort, strength, and
the space for every student to grow. The Fairfield Choir followed with
two well-loved songs — 听海 and Flashlight. While 听海 carried the calm rhythm
of ocean waves, Flashlight filled the hall with its message of hope. The
choir's harmonious voices had everyone singing along, creating a moment
that was both uplifting and unforgettable.</p>
<p>As the celebration drew to a close, Mr Wee, our Principal, delivered a
heartfelt address reflecting on the spirit of excellence that shines across
Fairfield — in classrooms, CCAs, and beyond. The hall erupted in applause
as outstanding teachers were honoured for their dedication and passion.
The 2025 Teachers’ Day celebration was not just a tribute, but also a reminder
of the lasting impact teachers have on their students and the school community.</p>

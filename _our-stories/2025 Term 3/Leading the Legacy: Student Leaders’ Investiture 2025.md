<p>The Student Leaders’ Investiture is held annually to commemorate Student
Councillors and Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) leaders as they assume new
leadership roles in Fairfield. Held on 1 July this year, the event was
centred on the theme <em>‘Garden of Eden’</em>, symbolising a flourishing
community of student leaders, much like the biblical Eden — a place of
purpose, growth, and unity. The theme also set the tone for the ceremony,
reminding everyone of the values and shared responsibility that the leaders
were called to embody.</p>
<p>As the principal’s words of encouragement drew to a close, the atmosphere
in the hall shifted from anticipation to reflection. The stage was now
ready for a more personal glimpse into leadership. The outgoing Council
President of 2024/2025, <strong>Eshe Choo</strong>, delivered an inspiring
and rousing speech about her leadership journey in Fairfield — a journey
marked by struggles with self-doubt, but ending in confidence, courage,
and hope, thanks to the unwavering support of her peers and teachers. Her
heartfelt reflections not only celebrated her own journey but also underscored
the collective effort of all leaders, naturally flowing into the moment
of recognising the contributions of her fellow council members.</p>

<p>During the appreciation segment for the Secondary Four student leaders,
the outgoing leaders passed the baton to the incoming appointed councillors
and CCA leaders. Beaming with pride, the incoming student leaders walked
up the stage to receive their letters of appointment. This ceremonial exchange
marked a turning point in the investiture, setting the stage for the incoming
Council President to articulate his vision for the year ahead.The newly
appointed Council President of 2025/2026, <strong>Seng Jun Hee</strong>,
delivered his inaugural speech, emphasising the importance of taking initiative,
no matter how small the act may be. With leadership formally handed over,
the ceremony moved toward its ceremonial climax.</p>
<p>Led by the heads of the Uniformed Groups, the squad marched solemnly from
the back of the school hall to the stage, with each movement executed in
perfect synchrony. The school flag was then passed from Eshe to Jun Hee,
symbolising the legacy handed down from one generation to the next. With
this new responsibility bestowed upon them, the leaders took the pledge,
vowing to uphold their duty. The Student Leaders’ Investiture was and will
always be a momentous occasion for the student leaders of Fairfield — a
celebration of leadership, dedication, and the enduring spirit of the student
community.</p>

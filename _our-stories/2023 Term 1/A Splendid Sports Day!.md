The Fairfield Sports Day at Ngee Ann Polytechnic on 10 March 2023 was a triumphant celebration of sportsmanship, unity, and resilience. After three years of safe-distancing restrictions, our staff and students were thrilled to finally participate in this highly anticipated event.

Excitement was in the air as the events kicked off, with male and female representatives from each Secondary One class competing fiercely in a fast-paced 100m race. The energy was infectious as the runners gave it their all, spurred on by the enthusiastic cheers of their peers. The relay race and ping pong competition were equally enthralling, with every class showcasing their best performances. In the end, the deserving winner of the Secondary One class was 1E.

The Secondary Two students battled it out in an intense tug-of-war competition, displaying creative strategies and teamwork. Spectators roared with excitement as each class gave it their all. The special teacher-versus-student match was a highlight, as it allowed the students to challenge their teachers' physical prowess.

The Secondary Three students demonstrated their prowess in Captain's Rugby, with loud cheers from their peers echoing throughout the two-level hall. The matches were exhilarating, and the level established stronger ties through these competitive matches.

The Secondary Four students had a blast playing a modified version of softball, with every team firing on all cylinders to earn valuable points. The students displayed great sportsmanship, with their classmates cheering them on throughout the games. In the end, Secondary 4D emerged as the ultimate victor.

The prize presentation was a memorable affair, with our former Vice-Principal, Mr Lim Sin Heng, receiving a warm welcome from the crowd. The victors were cheered on enthusiastically, and the upbeat atmosphere continued even after the event. Fairsians chattered excitedly about the fun-filled Fairfield Sports Day, which was a roaring success.

Overall, the 2023 Fairfield Sports Day was a shining example of camaraderie and unity, with Fairsians flourishing as One Fairfield. We are proud of our students' dedication and resilience, and grateful to our staff for organising such a fantastic event.

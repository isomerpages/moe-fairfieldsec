by Daniel Gan (Sec 4A), Sarah Chan (Sec 4B), Kayla Ng (Sec 4B) and Kylee Tan

Known for having a calm disposition, Kylee was well-liked by her peers. She was also an independent learner who displayed enthusiasm and diligence in her studies and needed minimal supervision in her assigned tasks. Kylee also took the initiative to broaden her horizons by taking part in the OnePeople.sg Model United Nations (OPMUN) Conference. An active and enthusiastic member of Fairfield English Drama, she took part in many school-based drama performances. Furthermore, she served as the President of Fairfield Journalism Club from 2021 to 2022, where she effectively guided and mentored her juniors in the writing of articles to promote school pride. Kylee's flair for writing also enabled her to win the Reader's Choice Award for Rice Media X Dialogic Op-Ed Essay Competition in the under-16 category in 2020.

On 12 January 2023, Kylee received her GCE O-Level examination results and emerged as one of Fairfield’s outstanding all-round students. A wave of sentiment washed over her as she recounted her journey as a Fairsian.

“Kylee Tan from 4E.” I was overwhelmed by the deafening applause as I climbed the steps to the stage. I was beyond overjoyed after being named as one of the outstanding all-round students of my cohort! My hard work, late nights, and countless hours hunched over books had been worth it. As I gazed at the sea of friendly faces before me, a wave of nostalgia washed over me. So many fond memories were formed here in this beloved Chen Su Lan Hall. One thought rang through my mind: “I made it.” It felt unreal. As I returned to my seat, the years that I had spent in Fairfield flashed through my mind.  

When my seniors told me that the transition from lower secondary to upper secondary would be difficult, I did not know what to expect. Truly, it was a big jump! The content was so challenging that I started doing badly in my studies. Staying up late at night to study only left me drained and unable to be attentive in class. I constantly felt disappointed with myself, as my life seemed to be punctuated with failures and setbacks.

In Secondary 3, I was appointed as the President of Journalism. Besides juggling many subjects as a triple science student, I had to vet articles throughout the school year. Additionally, I was involved in various activities in Fairfield English Drama Co-Curricular Activity (CCA). I also chose to participate in the OnePeople.sg Model United Nations (OPMUN) Conference. Thus, I found it increasingly difficult to manage so many tasks.

Dividing my time between my studies and my key appointments in CCA was a challenge at first. Initially, I had the misconception that as a student leader, I had to shoulder most of the responsibilities. However, my teacher encouraged me to do my best and believed that the Journalism EXCO members had the potential to make the CCA better. We helped one another and worked alongside one another so that we could handle our first CCA, second CCA and schoolwork well.

Upon reflection, I am really thankful to my schoolmates, classmates and good friends who generously shared their coping strategies with me. They also encouraged me to set high but realistic targets. Thus, I became more competent in prioritising and managing my workload.  Additionally, my parents provided me with resources and advice when I needed them. My seniors also guided me along, while my juniors encouraged and supported me. Lastly, I want to thank my teachers who helped me to improve my grades and achieve my goal.

To the 2023 batch of Secondary 4 and 5 students, I have a few pieces of advice for you. Ensure you have sufficient sleep every night, so that you have enough energy to focus on what your teachers are going through in class. Consistent revision is also very helpful. Utilise every spare moment to look through what was taught in class and practise your Ten-Year Series questions regularly. Ask your friends and teachers for help when necessary, and just focus on doing your best.

Overall, my journey in Fairfield was definitely a fruitful one, as I learnt many life lessons and got to know many friends along the way. Thank you, Fairfield, for providing me with the perfect environment to flourish!

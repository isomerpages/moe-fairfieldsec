<p>After studying and working hard together as a cohort in Semester 1, the
Secondary Ones were finally going for their long-awaited camp from 15 to
17 May 2024. The excitement was palpable as students gathered early in
the morning, their chatter and laughter echoing through the school corridors.
For some students, this would be their first night adventure away from
home. Bursting with anticipation, they ‘took flight’ for PAssion Wave @
Sembawang, ready to immerse themselves in nature, forge new friendships,
and participate in thrilling team-building activities.</p>

<p>One of the most exhilarating experiences of the camp was dragon boating
at Jurong Lake Gardens. Despite the heavy rain that curtailed some activities,
the students' spirits remained high. They donned their gear, split into
three teams, and eagerly boarded their boats. Under the guidance of experienced
coaches, they learned to paddle in unison. Once they got the hang of it,
a spirited race ensued. The students splashed water at each other, their
laughter and cheers resonating across the lake. The camaraderie and joy
experienced during this activity were truly unforgettable.</p>
<p>Another highlight of the camp was the outdoor cooking activity. This wasn’t
just about preparing a meal; it involved a lively bidding process for ingredients
using tokens earned from mini games. The bidding wars were intense, with
students shouting numbers and vying for the best ingredients. The excitement
continued as they worked together to cook their meals. Their efforts culminated
in a delicious feast which was devoured in seconds, leaving them hungry
for more.</p>
<p>The second day concluded with a much-anticipated campfire. Each class
prepared performances filled with cheers and dances, showcasing their creativity
and enthusiasm. The campfire was a spectacle of vibrant energy, with students
cheering for their peers and dancing along. The night was filled with applause
and laughter, creating an atmosphere of joy that left everyone beaming
with pride and happiness.</p>
<p>All too soon, the camp came to an end. As the students boarded the bus
back to school, they carried with them not just their belongings, but also
a treasure trove of memories and newfound friendships. The camp was more
than just an outdoor adventure; it laid strong foundations for the students'
secondary school journey, fostering unity and resilience.</p>

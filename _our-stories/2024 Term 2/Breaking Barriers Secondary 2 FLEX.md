<h3>Breaking Barriers: Secondary 2's (FL)-EXciting Journey of Embracing Diversity</h3>
<p>by Mikaela Faith (Sec 2C), Erica Ng (Sec 2D), Fayth Wai (Sec 2D), Goh
Yu Qian (Sec 2H) and Sarah Goh (Sec 3E)</p>
<p>The Weighted Assessment season for the Secondary 2 students has finally
come to a close! Now, what lies ahead for these students? Fear not, as
the Secondary 2 students embarked on three core events packed with various
activities that were focused on appreciating different abilities and fostering
family harmony from 15 May to 17 May 2024.</p>
<p>The first event aimed to broaden their understanding of diverse capabilities.
In an era often marked by high expectations, the ‘diff-ability’ workshop
stood out as highly relevant. It offered experiences ranging from group
games with unique sound effects simulating the challenges faced by individuals
with autism, to learning sign language for the deaf and crafting fidget
cubes for those with ADHD. Among the exercises, seated volleyball left
a lasting impression, where students experienced mobility impairments by
using only their upper bodies, gaining profound insights into the daily
hurdles faced by individuals with cerebral palsy. Each station deepened
their empathy and awareness of 'diff-abilities'.</p>

<p>Day 2 dawned with the arrival of FAMQUEST, a role-playing activity where
students formed 'families' to navigate life's pivotal choices. This interactive
experience revolved around maneuvering through stations representing significant
decisions impacting family dynamics. These choices, symbolised by physical
currency denoting 'love', 'joy', and 'wisdom', were crucial for achieving
victory. Building harmony within the 'family' proved vital to overcoming
challenges, fostering teamwork and breaking down social barriers among
students. FAMQUEST not only strengthened class bonds but also instilled
a shared understanding of the importance of harmony in real-life family
settings.</p>
<p>On the same day, each Secondary 2 class embarked on immersive learning
journeys like dining in the dark to simulate blindness, thereby applying
their newfound knowledge from the workshops on 'different abilities'. In
particular, Secondary 2C visited a home for individuals with autism. Upon
arrival, students were warmly greeted by the residents, who engaged them
in drawing activities. The students learned to draw a flower from the instructor,
before guiding residents through the process. The warmth of their interaction
lingered long after reluctant goodbyes were exchanged, leaving a lasting
impact on both groups.</p>
<p>Throughout the week, the Secondary 2 students showcased resilience as
they tackled challenges and laid strong foundations for their understanding
of individuals with different abilities, acknowledging their often-underestimated
strengths and daily hurdles. As the week drew to a close, the memories
of these transformative events remained vivid. Strengthening bonds and
deepening insights, the Secondary 2 students wholeheartedly immersed themselves
in a week brimming with laughter, curiosity, and profound learning experiences,
exemplifying excellence in their endeavours. This FLEX week will undoubtedly
be cherished as an unforgettable journey for all involved.</p>

On the morning of 4th August 2023, Fairfield joyously commemorated a significant event - her 135th Founder's Day. This special day was marked by meticulously planned pre-service and service activities that encapsulated Fairfield's rich history and enduring values. The Guest of Honour (GOH), none other than our esteemed Minister of Education, Mr. Chan Chun Sing, graced us with his presence, marking this day as a significant milestone in Fairfield's illustrious legacy. 


Minister Chan's early arrival was a testament to his enthusiasm for the occasion. He took the time to immerse himself in Fairfield's rich heritage, embarking on an inspiring journey through our school. As he explored Fairfield’s Archives Room, student leaders from both schools served as knowledgeable guides, unveiling the profound significance of various artefacts and the selfless individuals who have played pivotal roles in shaping Fairfield's identity over the years. This enlightening experience left Minister Chan with a newfound appreciation for Fairfield's illustrious history.

His next stop was the idyllic Sunshine@Fairfield, where our talented student baristas proudly prepared and served their meticulously crafted beverages to the Minister. The rich aroma of freshly brewed coffee and the warm hospitality of our students created an atmosphere of joyous interaction.

One of the highlights of the 135th Founder's Day Service was Minister Chan’s succinct yet powerfully delivered speech, in which he emphasised the core values in education and shared on the 'Three Beyonds': beyond ourselves, beyond our school, and beyond the here and now. He challenged all Fairsians to aspire to even greater heights, urging us to make the best use of our blessings. As a token of appreciation, a beautiful painting titled ‘Flourishing as One Fairfield’ was presented to Minister Chan. This artwork symbolises the strength found in diversity and the boundless potential that emerges when Fairsians come together to thrive as one community.

To conclude this service, a heartwarming montage beautifully encapsulated the essence of this year’s events, featuring highlights such as the Carnival@Fairfield and the Fairfield Musical. Following this, Minister Chan, alongside our school leaders and esteemed partners, led the audience in a heartfelt rendition of a birthday song dedicated to Fairfield. As the voices of all joined in harmonious unity, the 135th Founder's Day Service came to a close, leaving everyone in attendance with a profound sense of pride and unity.

Fairfield's legacy is a testament to her enduring commitment to excellence. More importantly, it is a testament of God’s goodness and faithfulness! As we celebrate 135 years of history, we look forward to many more years of blessings, achievements, and the continued flourishing of our beloved Fairfield community.

<h2>Flourishing Friendships Far From Fairfield</h2>
<p>by Mikaela Tay (Sec 3D), Goh Yu Qian (Sec 3G), Alicia Ng (Sec 3D) and
Fayth Wai (Sec 3E)</p>
<p>From 20 to 24 May 2025, 58 selected Secondary 3 students proudly represented
Fairfield Methodist School (Secondary) on the Trips for International Experience
(TIE) to Vietnam and Thailand. More than just overseas travel, these trips
were thoughtfully designed to cultivate global-mindedness, foster cross-cultural
understanding, and inspire students to serve and learn beyond the classroom.</p>

<p>The TIE Vietnam team explored the vibrant city of Ho Chi Minh, where they
immersed themselves in the nation’s rich history. Visits to the renowned
War Remnants Museum and the Cu Chi Tunnels brought history to life, allowing
students to gain a deeper appreciation of Vietnam’s resilience and heritage.
At Viet Anh School 2, students engaged warmly with their Vietnamese peers,
sharing insights about Singapore’s culture and forming meaningful cross-cultural
connections. A hands-on experience with the culture and traditions of Vietnamese
coffee added a unique local flavour to their learning journey — offering
students a window into everyday life in Vietnam.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the TIE Thailand team travelled to Chiang Mai, where they had
the privilege of visiting the prestigious Prince Royal’s College. Students
were inspired by the school’s advanced curriculum and stunning architecture
— an eye-opening experience for many. Their visit to Vineyard Methodist
School allowed them to introduce traditional Singaporean games and snacks,
such as chapteh and country erasers, to their Thai peers. Despite language
differences, the students formed lasting bonds, proving that friendship
transcends borders and that shared laughter and learning create powerful
connections.</p>
<p>As the trips drew to a close, both teams returned with more than souvenirs
— they came home with precious memories, personal growth, and a broadened
worldview. Through every interaction, challenge, and cultural experience,
Fairsians demonstrated resilience and unity, living out the school’s values
on an international stage. These trips are a powerful testament to how
Fairfield continues to nurture caring citizens who are ready to make a
difference — both at home and beyond our shores.</p>

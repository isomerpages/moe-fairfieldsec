### Hoops, Fairfield Did it Again!


by Lee Rae-en Amelia (Sec 2B) and Sarah Chan Xuan Ern (Sec 3B) 

  

Fairfield’s basketball team displayed grit and tenacity to advance to the finals of the South Zone ‘C’ Division Basketball Championships against National Junior College (NJC). Throughout this competition season, our ‘C’ division boys showed great teamwork on the court.

  

“Beep!” The whistle signalled the start of the match as both teams eagerly jumped into the air to grab the ball. When the NJC players had the ball, our boys quickly got into their defence positions, while staying alert and focused on regaining possession. Our Fairfield basketballers’ hunger to win enabled them to get the ball back and score their first basket! The crowd erupted in cheers as the basketball seniors proudly waved the Fairfield flag high in the air.

The audience’s attention was immediately captured as the choir began their performance with an uplifting song titled ‘Why We Sing’. Numerous amazing songs such as ‘Hikari Ga (The Light)’ and ‘Just A Single Voice’ were not only beautifully sung but were actually conducted by Fairfield Choir’s very own student conductors, Nathaniel and Kayden.  

After a brief intermission, Fairfield Choir came back with even more exciting and wonderful performances. Each level prepared a spectacular rendition of their own, singing songs like ‘Everlasting Melody’ and ‘For Good’ from the famous musical ‘Wicked’. Up next was the last segment ‘Disney Dazzle’. Each choir member donned colourful outfits as they sang popular Disney songs like 'Tale As Old As Time' from the well-known movie ‘Beauty And The Beast’ and ‘Arabian nights’ from the movie 'Aladdin’. With fun actions and an amazing dance break by student conductor Jayden, this mashup became an immediate crowd favourite.

<p>Colourful decorations adorned with vibrant shades of red and gold filled
every corner, signalling the start of the much-anticipated annual Multi-Ethnic
Celebrations (MEC) concert. Students and teachers alike donned their ethnic
costumes, creating a sea of diverse colours in the crowd. As the student
emcees took the stage, the atmosphere buzzed with excitement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ceremony kicked off with the emergence of a majestic lion head from
the stage corner. Its intricate scales shimmered in the bright light, symbolising
power, strength, and good fortune. A skilled performer brought it to life,
moving in perfect harmony with the others. The energetic beats of the drum
echoed through the hall, eliciting thunderous applause at the wonderful
performance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, performers from Sri Warisan took the stage, dressed stunningly in
traditional attire representing Chinese, Malays, and Indians. Their act,
titled ‘Dance Harmony’, showcased a fusion of various traditional art forms
into one captivating performance. Students were moved to sway and clap
along to the catchy tunes, feeling deeply connected to the diverse cultures
represented. The graceful choreography of each performer exemplified the
unity within diversity, mirroring the Fairfield spirit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a spontaneous moment, the lead dancer invited students in ethnic costumes
to join them on stage. Enthusiasm filled the air as friends linked arms
and were immersed in the joy of dancing to the rhythmic beat. Throughout
the hall, a sense of jubilation and camaraderie prevailed as students and
teachers came together to celebrate the commencement of Chinese New Year.</p>

<p>As the Multi-Ethnic Celebrations concert drew to a close, echoes of joy
and music lingered in the air. Through the promotion of racial sensitivity
and inclusivity, Fairfield’s Mult-Ethnic Celebrations lay strong foundations
for multi-racial harmony and hence helped Fairsians to grow stronger in
character and spirit. By embracing and celebrating our differences, we
strengthen the bonds that hold our community together. Students, with contented
smiles, gathered in small groups, bidding farewell and reminiscing about
the day's festivities. Although the celebrations had ended, the memories
forged will endure.</p>

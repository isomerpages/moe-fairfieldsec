#### Counselling

The social and emotional well-being of each student is of utmost importance. Counselling thus provides a platform for students to tap on should they struggle with any challenges.

  

During the secondary school journey and in the life of a teenager, we recognise that students may face many challenges. These difficulties could range from academic stress, school anxiety, peer relationship issues, changes in family dynamics, grief etc. They may be overwhelming for students and cause them to feel stressed, angry, sad, anxious, frustrated, and other low moods. Counselling is therefore helpful as it can guide students in discovering new coping mechanisms, making changes and managing their problems more effectively.

  

#### Special Educational Needs

Recognising that every student can learn, we aim to provide timely and appropriate support for our students with needs in an inclusive school culture.

  

The tiered-system of support involves the use and review of data on students’ performance and progress to inform on their level of needs and intensity of support required by the different personnel in the school. Depending on their needs, interventions may target areas such as literacy, social skills and behavioural management.

Transition support is a planned and goal-oriented process that facilitates a student’s successful transition into a new setting. These support structures aim to help every student gain confidence and build life skills that will help them as they journey through their secondary school education and beyond.

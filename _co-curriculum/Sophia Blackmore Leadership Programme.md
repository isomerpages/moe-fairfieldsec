<h3>Sophia Blackmore Leadership Programme</h3>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>Fairfield’s Sophia Blackmore Leadership Programme (SBLP) seeks to develop
influential leaders <strong><u>anchored in values</u></strong> and <strong><u>skilled in the 4 Fairfield leadership practices</u></strong>.</p>
<p>The school adopts John Maxwell’s definition of leadership which is based
on the idea that “Leadership is Influence” and not on position or title.
Fairsians are taught that they can lead themselves and at the same time,
they follow a leader because of who he/she is and what he/she represents.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>4 Fairfield Leadership Practices</h4>
<p><strong>Modeling Purity &amp; Honesty</strong>
</p>
<p>• Leaders lead by example, demonstrate integrity and live according to
their values.</p>

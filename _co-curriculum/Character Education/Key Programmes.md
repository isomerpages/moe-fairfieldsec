### Key Programmes

The school is guided by John C. Maxwell’s philosophy that “Leadership is Influence”. Therefore, we believe that every Fairsian can be an influential leader who demonstrates the traits of personhood, commitment and service.

  

#### (a) Lifeskills Curriculum

A structured lifeskills curriculum that includes modules such as values education, sexuality education, leadership and service learning is integrated as an essential component of the school’s enriching Character & Leadership Education programme. Lessons are holistically developed and experientially delivered to help pupils acquire knowledge and grow in socio-emotional competencies. A journaling component is included as part of the assessment criteria to emphasise the importance of personal reflection.

  



#### (b) Career Guidance


All students go through a Career Guidance module as part of the CCE Curriculum. A Career Guidance Day is also organised to prepare Secondary 4/5 pupils for life beyond secondary school. The programme includes dialogue sessions with Former Fairsians who have established their careers in different industries, as well as talks by representatives from Institutes of Higher Learning. Differentiated talks across the streams and visits to several polytechnics also help pupils to understand the criteria and content for various courses and make more informed choices in their post-Secondary education endeavours.  

  

#### (c) Trips for International Experience

Recognising the increasing need for Singaporeans to be global in outlook and to be able to operate in multi-national settings, Fairfield provides a range of both academic and non-academic internationalisation trips. These experiences are aimed at developing pupils to be culturally savvy by exposing them to the world, while sensitising them to Singapore in relation to its global context, and deepening pupils’ commitment and rootedness to Singapore.

  

Selected Secondary 3 pupils have the opportunity to serve the global community through the Trips for International Experience (T.I.E.). Partnerships with agencies have enabled our pupils to go beyond Singapore to serve in other countries and to develop 21st Century skills sets to raise global awareness.

  

#### (d) School-based National Education Activities

Pupils take part in meaningful celebrations of Singapore’s cultural diversity and commemorations of significant days of nation-building throughout the year. National Education learning journeys also take place as extensions of the Instructional Programme. Activities are also planned to promote active citizenry amongst pupils. Students consolidate their learning experiences through structured avenues that allow them to reflect deeply and to share with the rest of the pupil population.

  

#### (e) Values in Action (VIA)

Values in Action (VIA) in FMS(S) plays an important role in living out one of the four Fairsian Outcomes: Heart of Service.

  

The VIA programme is crucial in developing the characters of our students as students will have the opportunities to serve the larger communities beyond the school. The VIA activities serve to instil in students a sense of empathy and compassion for the less fortunate and provide a platform for the students to lead and serve others.

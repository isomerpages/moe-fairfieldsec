<h3>Sophia Blackmore Leadership Programme</h3>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>Fairfield’s Sophia Blackmore Leadership Programme (SBLP) seeks to develop
influential leaders <strong><u>anchored in values</u></strong> and <strong><u>skilled in the 4 Fairfield leadership practices</u></strong>.</p>
<p>The school adopts John Maxwell’s definition of leadership which is based
on the idea that “Leadership is Influence” and not on position or title.
Fairsians are taught that they can lead themselves and at the same time,
they follow a leader because of who he/she is and what he/she represents.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>4 Fairfield Leadership Practices</h4>
<p>Modeling Purity &amp; Honesty</p>
<p>• Leaders lead by example, demonstrate integrity and live according to
their values.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Encouraging Hearts, Enabling Unity</p>
<p>• Leaders recognise and empower their peers by fostering a supportive
and collaborative environment that sustains motivation and growth.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Stewarding Growth, Strengthening Resilience</p>
<p>• Leaders exhibit resilience and adaptability as they foster growth and
innovation. They dare to take risks, tackle challenges and improve their
environment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Inspiring Peaks of Excellence</p>
<p>• Leaders articulate a compelling vision for their school or community
by rallying others to join them in the pursuit of excellence.</p>

of exemplary leadership and seeks to equip our student leaders with these
skills.</p>

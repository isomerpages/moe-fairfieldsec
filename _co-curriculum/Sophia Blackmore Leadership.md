### Sophia Blackmore Leadership Programme

Fairfield’s Sophia Blackmore Leadership Programme (SBLP) seeks to develop students to be influential cultural leaders who are ready to take the lead to serve the immediate school community as well as the wider community at large. The school adopts John Maxwell’s definition of leadership which is based on the idea that “Leadership is Influence” and not on position or title. Fairsians are taught that they can lead themselves and at the same time, they follow a leader because of who he/she is and what he/she represents. 

  

The SBLP also aims to nurture leaders with a Personal Voice (PV). PV is defined as the ability to form sound opinions through listening to others and reflecting deeply; articulate opinions with respect and confidence; and having the moral courage to speak up and stand up for one’s beliefs.

  

With a strong PV, student leaders will be able to influence the student body and shape the culture of a student-led school. This is done in tandem with the push to strengthen moral and performance character, promote active citizenry and inspire students to serve.

  

#### Leadership Skills Framework

The school has adopted James Kouzes and Barry Posner’s five practices of exemplary leadership and seeks to equip our student leaders with these skills.

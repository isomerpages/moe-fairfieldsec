<h4>Overview</h4>

influential leaders <strong><u>anchored in values</u></strong> and <strong><u>skilled in the 4 Fairfield leadership practices</u></strong>.</p>
<p>The school adopts John Maxwell’s definition of leadership which is based

they follow a leader because of who he/she is and what he/she represents.</p>

<p>Fairfield’s Sophia Blackmore Leadership Programme (SBLP) seeks to develop
students to be influential cultural leaders who are ready to take the lead
to serve the immediate school community as well as the wider community
at large. The school adopts John Maxwell’s definition of leadership which
is based on the idea that “Leadership is Influence” and not on position
or title. Fairsians are taught that they can lead themselves and at the
same time, they follow a leader because of who he/she is and what he/she
represents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SBLP also aims to nurture leaders with a Personal Voice (PV). PV is
defined as the ability to form sound opinions through listening to others
and reflecting deeply; articulate opinions with respect and confidence;
and having the moral courage to speak up and stand up for one’s beliefs.</p>
<p>With a strong PV, student leaders will be able to influence the student
body and shape the culture of a student-led school. This is done in tandem
with the push to strengthen moral and performance character, promote active
citizenry and inspire students to serve.</p>
<h4>Leadership Skills Framework</h4>
<p>The school has adopted James Kouzes and Barry Posner’s five practices
of exemplary leadership and seeks to equip our student leaders with these
skills.</p>
